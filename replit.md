### Overview
QGentic Intelligent Strategic EPM is an AI-enhanced, full-stack web application for comprehensive enterprise program management. It supports the entire program lifecycle—managing programs, workstreams, tasks, resources, risks, benefits, KPIs, and financial tracking via an intuitive dashboard. The project aims to provide a holistic solution for strategic decision-making and EPM integration, featuring real-time AI intelligence, a multi-agent architecture, and a formal ontology for expert guidance. Key capabilities include multi-modal input analysis, anti-bias research, document intelligence enrichment, and the conversion of strategic decisions into actionable EPM program structures.

### User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

**Development Philosophy:**
- No band-aid fixes or workarounds (e.g., making fields nullable to bypass foreign key constraints)
- Always fix root architectural issues properly the first time
- Take time to understand the proper data flow before implementing fixes
- Clean separation of concerns - don't mix old and new system architectures

### System Architecture

#### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend uses React, TypeScript, and Vite, with Shadcn/ui (Radix UI and Tailwind CSS) for a themeable "New York" style UI. It offers a single-page application experience with mobile responsiveness, skeleton loading, and toast notifications, applying responsive design principles with Tailwind's `sm:` breakpoint for mobile-to-desktop transitions.

#### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite, TanStack Query, Wouter.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js (ES modules), Passport.js for session-based authentication, Express sessions, and a RESTful API with role-based middleware.
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless driver and Drizzle ORM for type-safe schema and Zod validation.
- **Database Connection Management**: `DBConnectionManager` handles Neon serverless connections with `withFreshConnection()` and `retryWithBackoff()`.
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Session-based authentication via Passport.js with Replit OIDC, HTTP-only cookies, and a three-tier role system (Admin, Editor, Viewer).

#### Feature Specifications
- **AI Multi-Agent System**: Ontology-based, comprising an Executive Agent, Builder Specialist Agent, QA Specialist Agent, and a Multi-Agent Orchestrator supporting multiple AI providers.
- **Strategic Consultant & EPM Integration**: Transforms executive input into AI-analyzed strategic decisions and EPM program structures, including Five Whys (with AI validation and coaching), Anti-Confirmation Bias Research, EPM Conversion, Version Management, Strategic Decisions, and Intelligent Framework Selection.
- **Five Whys AI Coaching System** (October 2025): Intelligent quality control system that validates Five Whys analysis using AI-powered evaluation. Service (`server/services/five-whys-coach.ts`) evaluates answers against 7 criteria: causality (root cause vs symptom), relevance, specificity, evidence-based reasoning, duplication, contradiction, and circular logic. Returns three verdict levels: 'acceptable' (proceed), 'needs_clarification' (warn with override option), or 'invalid' (blocks until revised). Features interactive coaching modal (`client/src/components/five-whys/CoachingModal.tsx`) with validation issues, severity badges, click-to-ask follow-up questions, AI coaching chat, improved suggestions ("Use this version" button), revision textarea, and conditional override (only for needs_clarification). Integrated into WhysTreePage workflow - validates before accepting selections, adding custom Whys, and finalizing root causes. Multi-provider fallback ensures resilience. Prevents vague, circular, or off-track strategic analysis. API endpoints: POST `/api/strategic-consultant/five-whys/validate` (evaluates candidates), POST `/api/strategic-consultant/five-whys/coach` (provides interactive guidance).

- **Non-Blocking Progress UX**: UI/UX overhaul replacing blocking modals with truly navigable experiences, using a fixed-position progress card, `MinimizedJobTracker`, polling-based notifications, and automatic navigation to results.
- **Enterprise Data Encryption**: AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive business data at rest. Implemented for Strategic Understanding, Journey Sessions, and Strategic Entities/Knowledge Graph tables, with EPM Programs and Strategy Versions pending.
- **Full-Pass Export System** (October 2025, Enhanced with Rich Framework Analysis): Comprehensive enterprise-grade export functionality generating ZIP bundles containing strategic analysis and complete EPM program data in multiple formats. Generates 6 report formats: 3 standard (report.md, report.pdf, report.docx) + 3 UI-styled (report-ui.html, report-ui.pdf, report-ui.docx) plus JSON and CSV data files. Backend service (`server/services/export-service.ts`) loads full dataset from strategic understanding, journey sessions (including accumulated context with framework insights), strategy versions, EPM programs, and task assignments. Reports now include comprehensive framework analysis sections extracted from `journeySession.accumulatedContext.insights`: Five Whys Analysis (whysPath with question/answer pairs, rootCauses, strategicImplications), Business Model Canvas (all 9 blocks—Customer Segments, Value Propositions, Channels, Customer Relationships, Revenue Streams, Key Resources, Key Activities, Key Partnerships, Cost Structure—with flexible rendering supporting strings/arrays/nested objects, plus contradictions and gaps), Porter's Five Forces (all 5 forces with property name variation support for both camelCase and snake_case), and PESTLE Analysis (all 6 categories: political, economic, social, technological, legal, environmental, sourced from trendFactors or externalForces with nullish coalescing). Generates professional Markdown reports covering Strategic Understanding, Strategic Journey, Framework Analysis sections, Strategic Decisions, and ALL 14 EPM components (Executive Summary, Workstreams with tasks/dependencies/deliverables, Timeline & Critical Path, Resource Plan with internal/external team tables, Financial Plan with cost breakdown/cash flow, Benefits Realization, Risk Register with mitigation strategies, Stage Gates, KPIs, Stakeholder Map, Governance, QA Plan, Procurement, Exit Strategy) with comprehensive details, safe JSONB parsing (try-catch guards), defensive formatting (overallConfidence NaN protection), property variation handling.

Frontend `ExportFullReportButton` component integrated into Analysis Repository and EPM Programs list pages with mobile-friendly downloads (window.location.href for mobile, blob for desktop). Puppeteer dependencies (22 packages: glib, nss, gtk3, pango, cairo, xorg) installed for headless Chrome PDF generation. Export completes in ~6 seconds generating ~293KB ZIP with 10-13 files depending on data availability. Framework analysis content in reports matches website display richness with defensive data structure handling.
- **Document Intelligence Enrichment** (October 2025): Background job pipeline that automatically extracts knowledge from uploaded documents without blocking the upload flow. When users upload files (PDF, DOCX, Excel, images) via `/api/strategic-consultant/analyze`, the system queues a `document_enrichment` job that runs asynchronously. Worker service (`server/services/document-enrichment-worker.ts`) processes documents with min 500-char threshold, extracts entities via Strategic Understanding Service, and populates the encrypted knowledge graph with provenance metadata (sourceFile). Background job dispatcher (`server/services/background-job-service.ts`) polls every 15 seconds (`server/index.ts`) and routes jobs to appropriate workers with dynamic imports. Frontend notification system: `DocumentInsightsContext` (`client/src/contexts/DocumentInsightsContext.tsx`) manages state with localStorage persistence (`documentInsightsNotifications`, `seenEnrichmentJobs`), `DocumentInsightsFAB` (`client/src/components/DocumentInsightsFAB.tsx`) floating action button displays pending insights count badge (bottom-right, z-50), `DocumentInsightsPanel` (`client/src/components/DocumentInsightsPanel.tsx`) slide-over shows enrichment details with timestamp, entity count, "View in Knowledge Graph" navigation, and dismissal buttons, `useJobNotifications` hook (`client/src/hooks/useJobNotifications.ts`) polls `/api/document-enrichment/notifications` every 10 seconds with toast deduplication via `seenEnrichments` ref to prevent spam (critical fix preventing infinite toast notifications). Low-signal documents (<500 chars) marked as ignored silently with resultData.ignored=true. Enriched knowledge automatically available to future BMC/strategy/EPM runs. API endpoint: GET `/api/document-enrichment/notifications` (authenticated, returns last 24h completed jobs with understandingId, entityCount, fileName, completedAt). Integrated with App.tsx via DocumentInsightsProvider wrapper (authenticated users only).
