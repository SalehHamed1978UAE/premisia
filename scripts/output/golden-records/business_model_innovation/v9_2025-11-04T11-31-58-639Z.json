          "Cost structure analysis reveals an unsustainable economic model where monthly expenses typically consume 75-85% of sales revenue, with downtown Dubai rent premiums often exceeding the critical 6-10% revenue threshold needed for profitability, creating a misalignment between location strategy and financial viability.",
          "Customer segments and value propositions show strong alignment for premium positioning with tourists and business professionals, but the chosen dine-in service model contradicts the revenue optimization needs identified in the research, particularly for the high-turnover business district location."
