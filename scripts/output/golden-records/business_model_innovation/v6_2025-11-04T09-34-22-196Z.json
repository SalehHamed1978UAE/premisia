          "The traditional cafe concept faces a fundamental market reality contradiction - Dubai's coffee market is dominated by international franchise chains with proven franchise models, while traditional concepts struggle against market saturation. This creates a misalignment between the intended value proposition and actual market dynamics.",
          "There's a significant cost-revenue mismatch where the business model requires AED 420,000 monthly revenue to be viable, but operates in a market with 60% failure rates and intense competition from established chains. The high fixed costs (rent $100+ per sq ft) and franchise fees (2.5-8%) create unsustainable economics for traditional concepts.",
          "The customer segments research reveals a preference shift away from traditional cafe experiences toward specialty coffee concepts and premium experiences, indicating the target market may not exist as assumed. Young professionals (63% under 30) prefer convenience and consistency offered by established chains over traditional approaches."
