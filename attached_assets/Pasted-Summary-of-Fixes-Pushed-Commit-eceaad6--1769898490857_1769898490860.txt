  Fix: BenefitsGenerator improvements - Added food service patterns + removed

  Remaining Issues:                                                             
                                                                                
  1. EPM Program Name Bug - The title shows "Multi-Location Coffee Hub          
  Expansion" instead of "Turkish Kebab Shop Downtown Dubai Launch"              
    - Root cause: journeyTitle is not being passed correctly to                 
  ProgramNameGenerator                                                          
    - Need to investigate why version.sessionId doesn't match                   
  strategic_understanding.id                                                    
  2. Assignments still need testing - After the enum fix, Replit needs to:      
    - Pull latest code                                                          
    - Restart server                                                            
    - Run a new EPM generation                                                  
    - Verify assignments now have taskName, resourceName, dates, allocation     
                                                                                
  For Replit: Pull the latest code and restart. Then run a new journey to test  
  if:                                                                           
  - Assignments now populate correctly                                          
  - Benefits have better descriptions (not boilerplate)                         
  - Food service patterns are recognized
