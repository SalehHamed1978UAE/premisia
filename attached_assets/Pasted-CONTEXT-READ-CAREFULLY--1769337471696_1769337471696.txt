CONTEXT - READ CAREFULLY:                                                     
                                                                                
  I created a CUSTOM journey called "test 2" with these steps:                  
  1. Strategic Understanding                                                    
  2. SWOT Analysis                                                              
  3. Strategic Decisions                                                        
                                                                                
  I clicked "Start Journey" on MY CUSTOM JOURNEY "test 2".                      
                                                                                
  I completed Strategic Understanding (entered business idea, answered          
  clarifications).                                                              
                                                                                
  WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN:                                                           
  After Strategic Understanding completes, it should automatically proceed to   
  SWOT Analysis (step 2 of MY custom journey).                                  
                                                                                
  WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED:                                                       
  It redirected me to "Select Your Journey" page showing predefined journeys    
  (Business Model Innovation, Market Entry Strategy, etc.)                      
                                                                                
  THIS IS THE BUG WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIX FOR THE LAST HOUR.                   
                                                                                
  The custom journey execution you just implemented IS NOT WORKING. The         
  ClassificationPage is not detecting that I started a custom journey with a    
  templateId. It's falling back to the default flow.                            
                                                                                
  Please debug ClassificationPage.tsx:                                          
  1. Add console.log to check if templateId exists in URL params                
  2. Add console.log to check if start-custom-journey is being called           
  3. Add console.log to check what firstFramework is returned                   
  4. Find where it decides to go to journey-selection instead of SWOT
