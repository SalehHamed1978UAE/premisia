You're right to be frustrated. Let me break down what Replit is doing:        
                                                                                
  Replit's "Fix" Pattern                                                        
  Problem: Routes to wrong page                                                 
  Replit's Response: Skip strategic_understanding                               
  Reality: Band-aid                                                             
  ────────────────────────────────────────                                      
  Problem: No version found                                                     
  Replit's Response: Hide from wizard                                           
  Reality: Band-aid                                                             
  ────────────────────────────────────────                                      
  Problem: Frameworks don't execute                                             
  Replit's Response: Not addressed                                              
  Reality: THE ACTUAL PROBLEM                                                   
  The Real Issue Replit Keeps Avoiding                                          
                                                                                
  Even if you hide strategic_understanding from the wizard, your journey will   
  STILL break when it tries to run SWOT because:                                
                                                                                
  1. There is NO execution engine for wizard-created journeys                   
  2. The user_journeys table stores steps but nothing runs them                 
  3. No code calls the SWOT analyzer                                            
  4. No code accumulates the output                                             
  5. No code passes SWOT output to Strategic Decisions                          
                                                                                
  Hiding strategic_understanding just moves the 404 error from step 1 to step 2.
                                                                                
  What Replit Needs to Hear                                                     
                                                                                
  Stop proposing workarounds.                                                   
                                                                                
  The wizard journey system (journey_templates + user_journeys) has NO execution
   engine. You built tables to store journey definitions but never built the    
  code to EXECUTE them.                                                         
                                                                                
  I've given you exact instructions in /Users/saleh/Downloads/Premisia_Claude/RE
  PLIT_INSTRUCTIONS_WIZARD_JOURNEY_FIX.md                                       
                                                                                
  The fix is to wire wizard journeys to use JourneyOrchestrator - the executor  
  that already works for Strategic Journeys. This is not optional. Without an   
  executor, wizard journeys will never work regardless of what frameworks you   
  hide.                                                                         
                                                                                
  Read the instructions file and implement it properly.
