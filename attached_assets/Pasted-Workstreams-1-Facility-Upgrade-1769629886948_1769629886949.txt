  Looking at the Gantt - NO "Food Safety" visible! That's progress. Let me      
  verify the data files:

  This is a SNEAKER store, not a food service business! The contamination is    
  still there.

  The industry validator is NOT working. The WBS generator is still using       
  "retail food service" templates for a sneaker store.

  This is a SNEAKER STORE getting "retail food service" content.                
                                                                                
  The V2 engine is running (FTE normalization worked), but:                     
  1. The WBS/workstream generator is still using wrong templates                
  2. Benefits transformation not working                                        
  3. Confidence variance not working                                            
  4. Industry validator not blocking contamination                              
                                                                                
  The problem is in the workstream generation layer, not just the export layer. 
  The WBS Builder or workstream templates are producing food service content    
  regardless of the input.
