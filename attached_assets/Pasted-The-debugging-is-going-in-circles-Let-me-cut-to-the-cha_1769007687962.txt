The debugging is going in circles. Let me cut to the chase.                   
                                                                                
  Current state:                                                                
  - Multi-agent system WAS working (logs showed 7 agents on Round 1)            
  - Now returning 500 errors instantly                                          
  - Python logs not appearing in workflow output                                
                                                                                
  The instant 500 error means the failure is at initialization, not during agent
   execution. Common causes:                                                    
                                                                                
  1. Import error in Python code after recent edits                             
  2. Missing dependency (crewai, langchain, etc.)                               
  3. Environment variable (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not passed to Python)              
                                                                                
  Quick diagnostic - ask Replit to run this:                                    
                                                                                
  # Test Python directly without uvicorn wrapper                                
  cd services/agent-planner                                                     
  python -c "                                                                   
  from crews.program_crew import ProgramPlanningCrew                            
  print('Import OK')                                                            
  crew = ProgramPlanningCrew('test', {'name': 'Test', 'type': 'test', 'scale':  
  'smb', 'description': 'test'}, {})                                            
  print('Init OK')                                                              
  "                                                                             
                                                                                
  This will show the actual Python error if there's an import/init problem.     
                                                                                
  What's the current status? Did the latest test work?
