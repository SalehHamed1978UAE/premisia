these are the 6 journeys we have planned at the moment:

Yes, I have the 6 journeys mapped out from our previous discussion:
Journey Catalog (6 Journeys Planned)

Market Entry Journey

PESTLE → Trend Analysis → BMC → Five Whys


Business Model Innovation Journey

Five Whys → BMC → Blue Ocean


Competitive Strategy Journey

Porter's → SWOT → Blue Ocean


Digital Transformation Journey

Trend Analysis → BMC → SWOT


Crisis Recovery Journey

Five Whys → SWOT → BMC


Growth Strategy Journey

BMC → Porter's → Trend Analysis



Each journey represents a specific sequence of frameworks tailored to different strategic challenges. The idea was that the Strategic Consultant would analyze the user's input and intelligently route them to the appropriate journey.

Looking back at our discussions, we talked about the Strategic Consultant having intelligent routing logic but didn't detail the specific decision criteria. Here's what we established:
Journey Selection Logic (Conceptual)
The Strategic Consultant would analyze the user's input to determine:
1. Problem Type Detection

Market Entry signals: "launch in", "enter market", "expand to", geographic references
Business Model signals: "revenue model", "value proposition", "customer segments", "pricing"
Competitive signals: "competitors", "market share", "differentiation", "competitive advantage"
Digital/Tech signals: "digital transformation", "AI", "automation", "technology"
Crisis signals: "urgent", "declining", "crisis", "turnaround", "survival"
Growth signals: "scale", "expand", "growth", "increase revenue"

2. Urgency Assessment

Crisis Recovery for urgent/survival situations
Other journeys for strategic planning timeframes

3. Current State vs Future State

Where they are now vs where they want to be
Transformation need vs optimization need

What Replit Actually Built:
According to Replit's document, there IS framework selection logic but it's using "simple heuristics" (placeholder) rather than full AI:
G. Intelligent Framework Selection
- AI analyzes user input
- Routes between BMC and Porter's Five Forces  
- Currently uses "simple heuristics" (placeholder for full AI)
