A couple of final notes before Replit dives in:

  ### Build With Future Flexibility in Mind

  1. Collaboration & Access Control
     We’ll likely add comments, approvals, and role-specific views later.
     Please avoid assumptions that a strategy has only one owner. When you wire
     new tables (references, journey_sessions updates, etc.), keep userId or
     createdBy fields available so we can layer controls on top.
  2. Framework Configurability
     All readiness rules, required entities, and framework metadata should come
     from a config (not hard-coded switch statements). That lets us add new
     frameworks/journeys without sprawling code changes.
  3. Reference Scaling
     Research libraries can grow large. Use indexed columns (sourceType, topics,
     confidence) and pagination-friendly APIs. Also, keep the reference schema
     generic so we can plug in new source types (e.g., API connectors, internal
     databases) later.
  4. Job System Reuse
     Treat background journeys and single-framework runs as generic job types
     so we can add more automation (scheduled re-runs, nightly refreshes, etc.).
     The worker should pull job metadata rather than assuming one specific flow.
  5. Exports & API
     Assume we’ll expose exports via API/webhooks later. Keep generation logic
     modular and stateless—so a CLI or integration could call it without the UI.
  6. Knowledge Graph Evolution
     Store enough metadata (entity IDs, source links, timestamps) so we can
     visualize changes over time or compare journeys in the future.

  ### Design Guidelines Reminder

  Please follow the existing design system documented in design_guidelines.md:

  - Layout and spacing (8px grid, section padding, etc.)
  - Typography hierarchy (heading, body, captions)
  - Component styling (cards, badges, buttons, alert colors)
  - Dark-mode compatibility
  - Accessibility (contrast, keyboard focus states, ARIA labels for new panels/
    modals)

  Every new component (Strategy Hub cards, modals, research lists) must fit the
  existing look and feel.

  If you stick to those guardrails while implementing the plan, we won’t paint
  ourselves into a corner when we add collaboration, external integrations, or
  more automation later.
