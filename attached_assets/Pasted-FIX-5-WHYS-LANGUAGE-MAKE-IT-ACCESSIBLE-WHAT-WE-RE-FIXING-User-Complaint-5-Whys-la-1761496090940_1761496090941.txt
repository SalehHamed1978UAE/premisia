  📝 TELL REPLIT:

  "User feedback: 5 Whys language is too formal and professional. Need to 
  make it more conversational and accessible.

  Fix needed in server/strategic-consultant/five-whys.ts:

  GUIDELINES:

  Replace professional/academic language with conversational tone:

  ❌ AVOID:
  - "Analysis indicates..."
  - "Primary causal factor..."
  - "Operational inefficiencies..."
  - "Query acknowledged..."
  - "Hypothesis validated..."
  - "Strategic implications suggest..."

  ✅ USE INSTEAD:
  - "It looks like..."
  - "The main reason is..."
  - "How things are running..."
  - "Great question!"
  - "You're right about that..."
  - "This means..."

  PRINCIPLES:

  1. Conversational, not corporate
    - Write like you're talking to a friend
    - Use contractions (it's, you're, let's)
    - Short sentences
  2. Encouraging, not clinical
    - "Great insight!" vs "Valid observation"
    - "Let's dig deeper" vs "Further analysis required"
    - "You're onto something" vs "Hypothesis warrants investigation"
  3. Clear, not jargon-heavy
    - "main reason" vs "primary causal factor"
    - "how things work" vs "operational mechanics"
    - "looking at" vs "analyzing"
  4. Helpful, not distant
    - Explain WHY you're asking
    - Acknowledge good thinking
    - Guide the user gently

  SPECIFIC CHANGES:

  Update all LLM prompts in five-whys.ts to follow these patterns:

  Example 1: Initial Analysis

  // BEFORE (Too professional)
  const prompt = `Analyze the following business context and identify root 
  causes using the Five Whys methodology. Extract key causal relationships 
  and surface underlying assumptions that warrant validation.`;

  // AFTER (Accessible)
  const prompt = `Let's figure out what's really going on with your 
  business. I'm going to ask "why" a few times to get to the heart of the 
  issue. Think of it like peeling an onion - each layer gets us closer to 
  the real answer.`;

  Example 2: Asking Follow-up Questions

  // BEFORE (Too formal)
  const prompt = `Based on the identified causal factor, formulate 
  interrogative statements to probe deeper into the underlying mechanisms.`;

  // AFTER (Conversational)
  const prompt = `Okay, so we found that "${previousAnswer}". Now let's dig 
  a bit deeper. Ask yourself: why does this happen? What's causing this to 
  be the case?`;

  Example 3: Root Cause Identification

  // BEFORE (Too clinical)
  const prompt = `Analysis of causal chain indicates convergence on 
  fundamental structural impediment. Synthesize findings into actionable 
  root cause statement.`;

  // AFTER (Clear & friendly)
  const prompt = `Great! We've worked through several layers, and I think 
  we've hit the core issue here. Let me summarize what we've uncovered and 
  what it means for your business.`;

  Example 4: Presenting Results

  // BEFORE (Too dry)
  "Root Cause Analysis Complete. Primary causal factors identified with 
  supporting evidence chains."

  // AFTER (Engaging)
  "Alright, here's what we discovered! These are the real reasons behind 
  what you're seeing. Let's break down each one:"

  ---
  FIND AND UPDATE THESE SECTIONS:

  1. Initial prompt that starts the analysis
  2. Questions generated for each "why" iteration
  3. Transition text between levels
  4. Final summary/results presentation
  5. Any error messages or validation text

  ---
  TESTING:

  After making changes, test with:
  Input: "I want to open a coffee shop but sales are lower than expected"

  Check that the output:
  - ✅ Feels like a conversation, not a report
  - ✅ Uses friendly, encouraging language
  - ✅ Explains concepts clearly without jargon
  - ✅ Makes the user feel supported, not judged

  ---
  IMPORTANT:

  - ⚠️ Don't change the analytical logic - just the language/tone
  - ⚠️ Keep the same number of "why" iterations - just make them friendlier
  - ⚠️ Maintain data structure - only update prompt strings and result
  presentation

  Make these updates to all prompts in 
  server/strategic-consultant/five-whys.ts.

  After updating, test with a sample input and show me the before/after 
  output."

  ✅ Expected Result

  BEFORE:
  "Analysis indicates primary revenue underperformance stems from suboptimal
   customer acquisition mechanisms and insufficient market penetration 
  strategies."

  AFTER:
  "It looks like the main issue is that you're not getting enough customers 
  through the door, and your marketing isn't reaching the right people in 
  your area."
