claude code said: Still broken. It's routing to "Select Your Journey" instead of SWOT.          
                                                                                
  Replit's fix didn't work. The custom journey flow is still falling back to the
   pre-built journey selection page instead of continuing to the next step      
  (SWOT) in your custom journey.                                                
                                                                                
  Tell Replit:                                                                  
                                                                                
  The fix didn't work. After completing Strategic Understanding on my custom    
  journey "test 2" (Strategic Understanding → SWOT → Strategic Decisions), it   
  still routes to "Select Your Journey" page instead of proceeding to SWOT.     
                                                                                
  The ClassificationPage is not detecting that this is a custom journey with a  
  templateId, or the routing logic is still falling through to the default      
  journey-selection path.                                                       
                                                                                
  Check:                                                                        
  1. Is templateId being passed in the URL to ClassificationPage?               
  2. Is ClassificationPage actually calling start-custom-journey endpoint?      
  3. Is the response returning firstFramework: 'swot'?                          
  4. Is getFrameworkRoute('swot', ...) being called?                            
                                                                                
  Add console.logs to trace the flow and find where it's going wrong. 

  codex said: The fix isn’t fully wired yet—the custom journey still falls back to the
  legacy “Select Your Journey” screen after Strategic Understanding. That means
  the template ID isn’t being preserved through the intake flow, so
  ClassificationPage never calls the new execution API and just routes to the
  standard selector.

  Replit needs to check:

  1. URL propagation – When clicking “Start Journey” on your custom template,
     the router must include ?templateId=… in the strategic consultant URL. If
     that parameter is missing, the classification page won’t know you’re
     running a custom journey.
  2. ClassificationPage logic – In ClassificationPage.tsx, ensure the template
     ID is read from window.location.search, fetched via /api/journey-builder/
     templates/:id, and after confirmation it calls /api/journey-builder/start-
     custom-journey and the new /journeys/:sessionId/execute endpoint. If any of
     those fail, it falls back to /journey-selection.
  3. Error handling – Log any fetch failure in the browser console so we can see
     why it’s defaulting back to journey selection instead of navigating to the
     first framework.

  Until the template ID survives intake and the execution endpoint is triggered,
  custom journeys will keep landing on the template selector regardless of the
  backend work.
