Mapped from git history since the February 17, 2026 build window.

  - Baseline used: bfddc8ca (2026-02-17 21:00:59 +0400, explicit build/zip
    validation note) and post-fix publish c8fa4e13 (2026-02-17 18:21:35 UTC).
  - Since then: 71 commits total, 34 meaningful code commits (36 if counting the
    two late Feb 17 EPM commits), 19 auth/session-related commits, 10 “Published
    your App” deployments.

  What went wrong

  1. Auth/OAuth instability loop: repeated contradictory strategies (explicit
     code exchange -> remove it -> wait for callback propagation) indicates
     unresolved race behavior across Feb 18-20.
  2. Auth rollout was incomplete initially: later large retrofit (7547d9e8,
     53532e2d, d3e9ba0e) suggests many endpoints/pages were still
     unauthenticated or inconsistent.
  3. Several “fix” commits were effectively no-op for app code (only
     screenshots/local agent state), e.g. 5c15534d, cede1b4f, c645c399, plus
     update commits touching .local only.
  4. Ambiguity/clarification churn on Feb 23 changed core prompting repeatedly;
     output quality regressed toward noisy clarification/conflict text.
  5. EPM/export pipeline had runtime breakages late (explicitly fixed by
     e9e9d872 and 8fc15d81).
  6. Validation regression remains: strict export acceptance can fail while CLI
     validator reports pass.
     Evidence from Feb 23 GCC ZIP: FAIL in report.md (/tmp/epm_zip_review/
     report.md:15) and validation.json (/tmp/epm_zip_review/data/
     validation.json:2), while script run reported 100/100 pass.
  7. By contrast, your Feb 17 burnout ZIP stayed consistent/releasable: PASS in
     report.md (/tmp/burnout_zip_review/report.md:15) and validation.json
     passed.

  If you want, I can now generate a rollback plan with exact target commit
  options (c8fa4e13 vs bfddc8ca), plus a safe cherry-pick list of only the fixes
  worth keeping.
