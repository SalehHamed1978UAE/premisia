QGentic Strategic Lifecycle Platform – Target End State

  We want QGentic to feel like a complete strategic operations cockpit. Every
  initiative is a living strategic asset that users can explore, refine, and
  scale—all with full provenance and automated execution. Here’s the end state
  we’re aiming for:

  ———

  ### 1. One Place to Manage Strategic Initiatives

  - A “Strategies” tab shows every initiative (formerly “understanding”), each
    with:
      - A human-friendly title, journey count, reference count, and linked
        programs.
      - Status (active, draft, archived), last update, and quick actions
        (rename, archive, export).
  - Users can click any strategy to open a Strategy Hub page where everything
    related to that initiative lives:
      - Original strategic input and clarified statements.
      - A chronological journey timeline (versioned) showing each analysis run:
        start/end times, frameworks included, completion status, and references
        added.
      - Linked EPM programs generated from that initiative.
      - Totals for knowledge-graph entities, references, and journeys.
      - A “Start New Journey” button to branch into additional analyses without
        losing context.

  ### 2. Research & Reference Provenance, End to End

  - Every analyzer (Five Whys, BMC, Porters, PESTLE, Trend, etc.) records the
    research sources it uses: title, URL, confidence score, topics, snippets,
    and where it was applied.
  - A dedicated Research Library displays all references across journeys and
    programs with groupings, filters, and search. Each reference shows:
      - How confident we are in the source.
      - Which elements (e.g., BMC Value Proposition, PESTLE Political) relied
        on it.
      - Buttons to jump directly to the frameworks or program sections it
        supports.
  - Knowledge graph entities link back to their sources, and the UI makes it
    easy to trace a claim → entity → source.
  - Exports (PDF/Word/Markdown/UI-styled) include a references section,
    footnotes, references.json, and references.csv. Claims in the reports link
    back to their source entries.

  ### 3. Iterative Journeys with Background Execution

  - When users want to run another analysis (or add a single framework), the
    system checks whether everything needed is already in the knowledge graph
    and reference library.
      - If yes, it offers a “Run in background” option that queues the journey
        as a background job and sends notifications when done.
      - If not, it lists what’s missing (e.g., “need pricing references” or
        “clarify problem statement”) and provides buttons to collect that input.
  - The “Start Journey” dialog clearly shows what existing work will be reused
    (e.g., number of entities, references, previous frameworks).
  - The background job service handles these journeys just like EPM generation—
    users can close the page and a notification tells them when the new analysis
    is ready, including a summary of new references added.

  ### 4. Tight Integration with Knowledge Graph

  - Document uploads, strategic analysis, and journeys all feed the knowledge
    graph automatically. Each new insight is saved with provenance and
    confidence.
  - A “Knowledge Graph” view (accessible from the Strategy Hub) lets users see
    every entity extracted from their inputs and documents, grouped by type
    and source. They can explore relationships, mark validations, and see how
    entities fuel future analyses.
  - When a new journey begins, the analyzers inherit the existing knowledge
    graph and reference library, so they avoid redundant research and build on
    what’s already known.

  ### 5. Seamless Navigation & Exports

  - Breadcrumbs follow the user: Strategies > Initiative > Journey 2 > Porter's
    > Buyer Power.
  - Shared UI components (journey timeline, research lists, program lists) mean
    there’s no more jumping between unrelated tabs to understand an initiative.
  - Exports share a consistent structure: standard data outputs + UI-styled
    reports that mirror the app and carry full references.
  - Everything is ready to show to stakeholders: full context, traceable
    sources, and execution-ready plans.

  ### 6. Reliable Infrastructure & Messaging

  - Back-end data structures persist everything we’ve mentioned (journey
    versions, references, knowledge entities, job states).
  - Metrics help us see the strategic lifecycle evolve (total references,
    references by confidence, time saved by background execution).
  - User-facing copy makes it clear what the AI is doing, why, and how to supply
    missing info when needed.

  In short:
  QGentic becomes the single source of truth for every strategic initiative.
  Users can upload documents, run initial analyses, trigger new journeys in
  seconds (even in the background), and review the complete evidence trail that
  underpins their decisions and EPM programs—all without ever losing context.
