Thanks for the structure—this is exactly the direction we discussed. A couple
  of tweaks so the work stays concrete and testable:

  1. “Add more details to journey plan” – let’s flesh this out as: expand
     journey-registry.ts to include the richer schema (framework sequence,
     summary builder type, readiness defaults, dependencies), and seed it for
     the existing journeys. Please note here that Strategic Consultant and
     Strategy Hub will both read from this.
  2. “Create service for journey summaries” – make this explicitly “Implement
     JourneySummaryService to save/load summaries, and register summary
     builders keyed by JourneyType.” Include success criteria (e.g.,
     getLatestSummary(understandingId) returns the data from the last completed
     session).
  3. “Save and load journey progress” – specify the orchestrator changes: when a
     journey completes, call the summary service to persist; when a new journey
     starts, fetch the baseline summary and attach it to the context.
  4. “Update readiness checks using new rules” – note that /journeys/check-
     readiness should pull the thresholds from the registry (with overrides if
     needed) so both entry points share the same logic.
  5. “Show journey summaries in interfaces” – please spell out the UI work:
     update both Strategic Consultant and Strategy Hub modals to pull from the
     registry and display the latest summary snippet to the user before starting
     a journey.
  6. “Make script for new journey setup” – clarify that this script updates
     generated artifacts (modal options, readiness defaults, summary builder
     wiring) after a developer adds a new definition.
  7. “Create tests for all journeys” – call out the smoke test harness: iterate
     through every registered journey, simulate a run, and assert that summaries
     and readiness behave. This should go into CI.
  8. “Add tools for managing journeys” – specify whether this is a CLI or admin
     endpoint (e.g., pnpm run journeys:list, journeys:summary --understanding
     <id>), and what functionality we expect for phase one.

  If you fold those details into the task list, we’re good to go. Let me know
  when you’ve updated the list and we can kick off the first task.
