STOP. Read this completely before doing anything else.                        
                                                                                
  You keep declaring tasks "complete" but the user flow is still broken. This is
   not acceptable.

  MANDATORY: End-to-End Test Protocol                                           
                                                                                
  Before declaring ANY work complete, you MUST personally test this flow:       
                                                                                
  Test Flow: SWOT → Strategic Decisions → EPM                                   
                                                                                
  1. Start fresh - Create a new custom journey with these steps:                
    - Strategic Understanding                                                   
    - SWOT                                                                      
    - Strategic Decisions                                                       
    - EPM Generator                                                             
  2. Run Strategic Understanding - Enter business context, submit               
  3. Run SWOT - Verify it completes, check DB:                                  
  SELECT framework_name, created_at FROM framework_insights                     
  WHERE session_id = '[YOUR_SESSION_ID]';                                       
  4. Arrive at Strategic Decisions page - Should load WITHOUT errors:           
    - No 404                                                                    
    - No "Version not found"                                                    
    - Should show AI-generated decision options based on SWOT                   
  5. Complete Strategic Decisions - Make selections, submit                     
  6. EPM generates - Should complete WITHOUT "No BMC analysis found"            
  7. View EPM output - Should show real workstreams, timeline, etc.

  Current Bug: "Version not found"                                              
                                                                                
  The Strategic Decisions page expects data in strategy_versions table. Custom  
  journeys store data in framework_insights table. This is a data flow mismatch.
                                                                                
  Before you fix it, TRACE THE FLOW:                                            
                                                                                
  1. Where does CustomJourneyExecutor store SWOT results?                       
  2. What URL does it redirect to for Strategic Decisions?                      
  3. What API endpoint does that page call?                                     
  4. What table does that API query?                                            
  5. Is there data in that table?                                               
                                                                                
  Fix the actual mismatch, don't patch symptoms.

  Rules Going Forward                                                           
                                                                                
  1. No task is complete until the user flow works                              
  2. Test with real data, not mocks                                             
  3. Check database state at each step                                          
  4. If you hit an error, trace the full data flow before fixing                
  5. Do not declare done until YOU have completed the entire journey

  - strategy_versions table for this session?                                   
  - framework_insights table for this session?                                  
  - custom_journey_executions table for this session?
