The current project planning system generates Gantt charts with a major bug: deliverables appear outside their workstream date ranges (e.g., a deliverable in month 5 when the workstream ends in month 3). This happens because the current system doesn't understand project management logic - it just generates random dates.
The Solution: Intelligent Planning Module
We're building a completely isolated planning module that uses AI (GPT-4) to:

Understand project dependencies and logic
Schedule tasks using Critical Path Method (CPM)
Validate that the timeline makes sense
Fix issues like deliverables floating outside workstreams
Push back when timelines are impossible

Why Isolated Architecture?

Zero risk: Doesn't touch existing code
Easy rollback: One feature flag to switch on/off
Clean removal: Delete one folder to remove entirely
Parallel testing: Can run both systems side-by-side

How It Works
Current System:                    New Intelligent System:
Generate EPM → Bad Timeline        Generate EPM → AI Extracts Tasks → 
→ Broken Gantt Chart              CPM Scheduling → Validation → 
                                  Optimization → Valid Gantt Chart
```

### **The Module Structure**
```
src/lib/intelligent-planning/   ← Completely isolated folder
  ├── index.ts                  ← Entry point
  ├── task-extractor.ts         ← AI extracts tasks from strategy
  ├── scheduler.ts              ← CPM algorithm schedules tasks
  ├── validator.ts              ← AI validates logic
  ├── optimizer.ts              ← AI optimizes schedule
  └── epm-integration.ts        ← Converts to/from EPM format
Integration Strategy

Phase 1: Build isolated module (what we're doing now)
Phase 2: Test with feature flag OFF
Phase 3: Turn flag ON for testing
Phase 4: If it works, keep it; if not, turn OFF instantly
Phase 5: After stable, remove old system

Key Benefits

Fixes the deliverable bug: Ensures all deliverables are within workstream bounds
Intelligent scheduling: Uses AI to understand dependencies
Validates logic: Checks if the plan actually makes sense
Provides explanations: Can explain WHY the schedule is structured this way

What Replit Needs to Do
Take the uploaded files and organize them into an isolated module that can be turned on/off with one environment variable. No changes to existing code except one if-statement.
Success Criteria
When this is working:

Brooklyn coffee shop test will have valid timelines
No deliverables outside workstream dates
Timeline will make logical sense
Can explain its reasoning
Can instantly rollback if issues

This is a surgical addition - like adding a smart brain to the planning system without doing surgery on the existing code.
