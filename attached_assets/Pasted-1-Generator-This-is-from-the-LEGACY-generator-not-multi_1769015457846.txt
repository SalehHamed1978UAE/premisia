1. Generator: This is from the LEGACY generator, not multi-agent:             
    - "generator": "legacy"                                                     
    - "fallbackReason": "fetch failed" - The multi-agent system was tried but   
  failed (fetch to CrewAI service failed), so it fell back to legacy            
  2. Workstreams: 8 workstreams defined, which is reasonable for a restaurant   
  launch:                                                                       
    - Market research and competitor analysis                                   
    - Site selection and lease negotiation                                      
    - Wood-fired oven procurement                                               
    - Technology platform development                                           
    - Recruitment and training                                                  
    - Digital marketing                                                         
    - Operational efficiency optimization                                       
    - Restaurant opening                                                        
  3. Issues with the output:                                                    
    - Deliverables are mismatched: The deliverables for workstreams contain     
  research findings instead of actual deliverables. For example:                
        - T002 (Site selection) has a deliverable about "Dubai restaurants reach
   customers through multi-channel approach..." - this is research content, not 
  a site selection deliverable                                                  
      - T003 (Wood-fired oven) has a deliverable about "customer relationships" 
  - completely unrelated                                                        
    - Empty sections: Many sections are empty:                                  
        - resourcePlan.roles = []                                               
      - benefitsRealization.benefits = []                                       
      - kpis.metrics = []                                                       
      - stakeholderMap.stakeholders = []                                        
      - governance.structure = []                                               
      - qaPlan.standards = []                                                   
      - procurement.items = []                                                  
      - exitStrategy.strategies = []                                            
    - No CPM fields: No slack, isCritical on workstreams (because CPM           
  post-processing is only on multi-agent path)                                  
    - Critical path is shallow: Only 2 items [T006, T008]                       
    - Resource plan empty: totalCost=0, totalHeadcount=0                        
    - Executive summary is weird: The "title" is actually a strategic           
  insight/warning about market positioning, not a program title                 
  4. Positive aspects:                                                          
    - Has 8 workstreams with logical sequencing                                 
    - Dependencies are defined                                                  
    - Timeline exists with phases                                               
    - Budget: $1,771,000                                                        
    - Risk register has 3 risks                                                 
    - Overall structure is present                                              
  5. The key problem: This was a legacy generator fallback due to "fetch failed"
   to the CrewAI service. The deliverables are being populated with research    
  content instead of actual workstream deliverables - this is a data mapping    
  bug.                                                                          
                                                                                
  Let me provide a quality assessment.

  "generator": "legacy",                                                        
  "fallbackReason": "fetch failed"                                              
  This is NOT multi-agent output. The CrewAI service fetch failed, so it fell   
  back to legacy generator.

  The deliverables are pulling from BMC research output instead of generating   
  actual deliverables:                                                          
  // T002: Site selection - but deliverable is:                                 
  "Dubai restaurants reach customers through a multi-channel approach dominated 
  by food delivery aggregators..."                                              
                                                                                
  This is research content, not a "Site Selection Report" or "Signed Lease      
  Agreement".

  Quality: 4/10 - Structure exists but content is malformed. The legacy         
  generator has a bug where BMC research content is being mapped to deliverables
   incorrectly. Many sections are empty placeholders.                           
                                                                                
  The multi-agent path wasn't used because the CrewAI service fetch failed. When
   multi-agent works, it should produce richer, properly-structured content.
