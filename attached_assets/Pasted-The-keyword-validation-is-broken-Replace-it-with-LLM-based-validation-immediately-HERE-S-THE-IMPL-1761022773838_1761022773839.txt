The keyword validation is broken. Replace it with LLM-based validation immediately.

HERE'S THE IMPLEMENTATION:

1. In server/strategic-consultant/whys-tree-generator.ts, REPLACE the entire validateRootCause function:

async function validateRootCause(rootCause: string): Promise<{
  isValid: boolean;
  message?: string;
}> {
  const prompt = `
    Determine if this root cause addresses BUSINESS/OPERATIONAL factors or merely describes CULTURAL observations.
    
    Root cause: "${rootCause}"
    
    VALID root causes address:
    - Market dynamics, competition, pricing power
    - Customer behavior, loyalty, acquisition costs
    - Product/service differentiation, quality
    - Operational efficiency, cost structures
    - Technology capabilities, innovation
    - Financial models, unit economics
    
    INVALID root causes that are just cultural observations:
    - Cultural norms without business impact
    - Geographic stereotypes
    - Social traditions as endpoints
    - Organizational culture without operational link
    
    Respond with JSON only:
    {
      "isValid": boolean,
      "reason": "brief explanation"
    }
  `;

  try {
    const response = await generateContent(prompt, 'json_object');
    const validation = JSON.parse(response);
    
    return {
      isValid: validation.isValid,
      message: validation.isValid ? undefined : 
        `This appears to be a cultural observation rather than a business root cause. ${validation.reason}`
    };
  } catch (error) {
    // If LLM fails, allow it through rather than blocking
    console.error('LLM validation failed, allowing root cause:', error);
    return { isValid: true };
  }
}

2. DELETE the entire culturalKeywords array and keyword checking logic.

3. Test with Brooklyn coffee shop to verify:
   - "Customer loyalty creates competitive moats" → PASSES
   - "Cultural preference for tea over coffee" → FAILS
   - "Brand differentiation justifies premium pricing" → PASSES

This fixes the validation properly using AI understanding, not dumb pattern matching.
