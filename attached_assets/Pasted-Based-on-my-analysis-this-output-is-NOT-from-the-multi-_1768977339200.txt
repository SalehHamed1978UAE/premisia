Based on my analysis, this output is NOT from the multi-agent CrewAI system.  
  Here's the assessment:                                                        
                                                                                
  Is it Agentic?                                                                
                                                                                
  No. There's no generator: "multi-agent" field in the EPM output, and the      
  server code doesn't appear to have the multi-agent integration wired up yet.  
  The output was generated by the single-LLM epm-synthesizer.ts.                
                                                                                
  Quality Assessment                                                            
                                                                                
  The output is reasonably comprehensive but has several issues:                
                                                                                
  Strengths:                                                                    
                                                                                
  1. 7 workstreams with logical sequencing (Market Research → Lease → Design →  
  Construction → Inspections → Soft Opening → Grand Opening)                    
  2. 35 detailed deliverables across workstreams (highly specific: HACCP        
  compliance, PCI-DSS, ServSafe certification, etc.)                            
  3. Domain-specific resource plan (Head Roaster, Retail Store Manager, Lead    
  Barista, etc.)                                                                
  4. Abu Dhabi-specific context preserved (25-40 AED pricing, UAE licensing)    
  5. Realistic timeline (~9 months vs. the previous 166-month bug)              
                                                                                
  Issues/Gaps:                                                                  
                                                                                
  1. Deliverable mismatch - Workstream 1 "Market Research & Site Selection" has 
  deliverables about lease execution and construction, not research             
  2. KPI truncation - Names like "Strategic benefit: A specialty" are cut off   
  3. Benefits missing names - Shows "undefined" in Benefits Realization section 
  4. Quality Standards bug - Shows "[object Object]" instead of actual content  
  5. No generator metadata - Can't verify which system produced it              
  6. Resource assignments generic - All 7 tasks assigned to "internal-0" /      
  "Development Team"                                                            
                                                                                
  Is it Better Than Before?                                                     
                                                                                
  Mixed. The workstream structure is improved, but this specific run has data   
  mapping bugs (deliverables in wrong workstreams, undefined names). Without    
  seeing a baseline from the old system, I can't definitively compare.          
                                                                                
  Key Finding                                                                   
                                                                                
  The multi-agent CrewAI system is NOT being used. The USE_MULTI_AGENT_EPM=true 
  flag isn't connected to the EPM generation code. Replit needs to verify:      
  1. Is the CrewAI service on port 8001 being called?                           
  2. Is the response being used instead of epm-synthesizer.ts?
