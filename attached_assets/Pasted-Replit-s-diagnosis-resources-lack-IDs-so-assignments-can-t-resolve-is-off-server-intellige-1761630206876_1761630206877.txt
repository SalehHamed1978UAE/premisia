Replit’s diagnosis (“resources lack IDs, so assignments can’t resolve”)
    is off. server/intelligence/epm-synthesizer.ts#L2156 already generates a
    synthetic resourceId (member.id || internal-${index}), and the UI mirrors
    the same fallback (client/src/components/epm/AssignmentsPanel.tsx#L77-L92).
    Even without IDs in the stored resource plan, the front end can still map
    those assignments—so this isn’t why the critical path shows “Unassigned”.
  - The real blocker sits in src/lib/intelligent-planning/resource-
    manager.ts. findBestResources demands an exact, case-sensitive skill
    hit (r.skills.includes(requirement.skill)), and many tasks coming out
    of intelligent planning either (a) have no requirements array or (b) use
    phrasing that doesn’t exactly match the skill strings in the resource plan.
    The loop returns an empty array, so task.assignedResources stays blank and
    the Gantt/critical-path panels fall back to the literal string “Unassigned”.
    Over-allocation warnings then cite “Unassigned” because no actual resource
    was attached.
  - What Replit should implement:
      1. In resource-manager.ts, make the allocator tolerant: treat missing
         requirements as a generic need, compare skills case-insensitively / by
         substring, and when there’s still no match, fall back to the cheapest
         available resource so every task gets at least one assignment.
      2. Still in assignResources, stash both the resource IDs and the display
         names (e.g., task.assignedResourceNames) while assigning; this keeps
         downstream consumers from losing the person’s name.
      3. In src/lib/intelligent-planning/epm-integration.ts, keep propagating
         those IDs/names when transforming the validated schedule—set owner,
         assignedResourceIds, and assignedResourceNames from the task so the
         timeline/critical-path UI sees real people instead of “Unassigned”.
      4. Update the client type (client/src/types/intelligence.ts) if needed to
         include the optional assignedResourceIds / assignedResourceNames fields
         so TypeScript stays happy.
  - After the code changes, rerun intelligent planning for a sample program and
    confirm that Gantt/Critical Path and the schedule issue warnings list the
    actual resource names (e.g., “Operations Manager”) instead of “Unassigned”,
    and that overlapping-task alerts reference those names.
