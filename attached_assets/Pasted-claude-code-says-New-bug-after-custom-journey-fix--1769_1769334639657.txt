claude code says: New bug after custom journey fix:                                             
                                                                                
  Custom journey now routes to /strategic-consultant/analysis/{journeyId}       
  (correct!)                                                                    
  But shows: Analysis Not Found - 404: {"error":"Version not found"}            
                                                                                
  The start-custom-journey API creates a journey session but the analysis page  
  expects a "version" record that doesn't exist.                                
                                                                                
  Either:                                                                       
  1. The start-custom-journey endpoint needs to also create a version record    
  2. Or the analysis page route is wrong for custom journeys (should go to a    
  different page)                                                               
                                                                                
  Check what data the analysis page expects vs what start-custom-journey        
  creates.    

  codex says:  Custom journey execution still breaks after clarifications: now you get a 404
  “Version not found” when the system tries to open the first framework page.
  That means the new flow isn’t waiting for the journey session + version to be
  created before redirecting, so the frontend navigates to /strategic-
  consultant/analysis/journey_<timestamp>... with a version id that hasn’t been
  persisted yet. We need Replit to:

  1. Update startCustomJourneyExecution so it either returns the actual
     journeyVersionId generated after the frameworks run, or poll /
     versions/:sessionId until the first module produces a version before
     redirecting.
  2. Ensure the backend stores the new journey version and returns a valid
     journeyVersionId.
  3. Add a regression test for launching a custom journey end-to-end (Five Whys)
     to ensure the route resolves and no 404 occurs.

  Without that, custom journeys will always hit the “Analysis Not Found” screen.
