 Yes, I’m aware, and Replit’s summary is mostly right.

  Corrections to that summary

  1. A lot of “fix” churn was real, but several commits were effectively no-op
     for app code (only screenshots/local state), so signal was noisy.
  2. The biggest EPM regression I verified is validator inconsistency: export
     acceptance can fail while CLI validator still says pass.
  3. Gemini risk is plausible, but by February 23, 2026 you had a commit
     prioritizing Claude again (10f36c15).
  4. The “web-search 401” explanation is plausible from logs, but in current
     code /api/web-search is not auth-guarded, so that specific root cause is
     not fully proven from code alone.

  What you changed since February 17, 2026

  1. Auth/OAuth migration and stabilization (largest area): redirect loops,
     callback/session race fixes, token propagation, Supabase updates.
  2. API auth retrofit across many pages/components/hooks (authFetch style
     migration).
  3. AI provider behavior changes (Gemini fallback and later Claude
     prioritization).
  4. Ambiguity/clarification pipeline rewrites (prompting, journey-specific
     questions, clarification handling).
  5. EPM/export reliability fixes (generation crash import fix, export 401 fix,
     executive summary cleanup).

  What went wrong

  1. Auth strategy oscillated repeatedly (manual code exchange <-> no manual
     exchange <-> wait-for-session), causing instability and repeated
     regressions.
  2. Auth rollout was partial at first, then broadened later, so failures
     surfaced in waves.
  3. Too many concurrent changes across auth + ambiguity + AI provider + EPM/
     export made regressions hard to isolate.
  4. Validation pipeline divergence created false confidence (CLI pass while
     export artifact fails).
  5. Some commits with strong messages had little/no actual code effect, making
     diagnosis harder.

  Net assessment

  - Your feeling is accurate: after February 17, 2026, there was high-change,
    high-regression churn.
  - Rolling back to that known-good point is reasonable.
  - Safer approach than full rollback: rollback to that baseline, then cherry-
    pick only essential auth fixes.

  If you want, I can do this next:

  1. Create a safety branch from current main.
  2. Reset working branch to your chosen baseline (bfddc8ca or c8fa4e13).
  3. Cherry-pick a minimal vetted fix set.
  4. Run a validation/build checklist and give a go/no-go report.
