### Objective

  Only real locations should be sent to the disambiguation UI. Strings like
  “open”, “cafe”, “open cafe” must never reach the geocoder or the UI. Use
  the geocoder’s confidence scoring to filter aggressively and deduplicate
  overlapping matches.

  ### Implementation Steps

  1. Generate candidate phrases
      - Use contiguous windows of 1–4 words.
      - Skip any window containing non-alphabetic characters ([^a-zA-Z\s]).
      - Skip windows shorter than 3 characters.
      - Optional: a small connector whitelist (al, de, la, los, etc.).
  2. Normalize before lookup
      - Title-case each candidate (e.g., “madinat al riyadh” → “Madinat Al
        Riyadh”) but keep the original string for reference.
  3. Run through the geocoder
      - Query the geocoder for each candidate.
      - If no results or the best score < 0.6 (configurable), discard the
        candidate immediately.
      - Keep only the top result per unique phrase.
  4. Merge and deduplicate
      - If two candidates overlap (“open cafe”, “cafe”), keep the one with
        higher geocoder score; discard the others.
      - Deduplicate identical names in the UI so “Paris” only appears once.
  5. Minimum collection
      - If fewer than two valid candidates remain, skip the disambiguation
        prompt entirely (the resolver can auto-select the best match).
  6. Fuzzy fallback (optional)
      - If no candidate survives, do a fuzzy geocoder lookup with a tight
        tolerance. Present those as “Did you mean…” suggestions if necessary.
  7. Update the UI contract
      - Show a block only when you have 2–3 distinct high-confidence options
        to present.
      - Include the original normalized phrase in the prompt for clarity.
  8. Testing
      - Provide test cases:
          - “Paris” → single block with actual Paris choices.
          - “Open cafe in Paris” → one block for “Paris” only; nothing else.
          - “Madinat al riyadh” → normalized to “Madinat Al Riyadh” with correct
            disambiguation options.
          - Non-place sentences (“focuses on growth…”) → no disambiguation.
