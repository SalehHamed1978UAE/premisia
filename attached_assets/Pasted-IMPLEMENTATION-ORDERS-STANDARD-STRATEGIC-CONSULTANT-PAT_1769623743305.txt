IMPLEMENTATION ORDERS – STANDARD (STRATEGIC CONSULTANT) PATH

  We (Claude Code, Codex, and Claude) are all aligned. The following items must
  be completed before any further work proceeds:

  1. Add `transformResourcesToResourcePlan()` inside `server/strategic-
  consultant/epm-converter.ts`.
     - Transform the standard-path `resources[]` (headcounts) into the same
  `resourcePlan.internalTeam[]` structure that the exporter uses.
     - Rule: `count <= 10 ? count : count / 100` before normalization (so
  headcounts stay 1.0/2.0/etc., large numbers become percentages).
     - Call `normalizeResourceFTEs` on the transformed array to ensure decimal
  allocations (1.0, 0.8, etc).
     - Log any fixes so we can see the helper is being used.

  2. RUN A STANDARD (Strategic Consultant) JOURNEY TO CAPTURE EVIDENCE.
     After the transform is in place, run a fresh standard-path journey and
  attach:
     a. `resources.csv` showing decimal FTEs (1.0, 2.0…) instead of 100/80/75.
     b. Console log snippet showing `[EPM Converter] FTE normalization
  fixes: ...` (if any) and `[EPM Converter] Quality Gate Results: ...`.
     c. `benefits.csv` showing populated names and measurable targets (no
  “Unnamed” or “-”).
     d. JSON snippet or screenshot showing varied confidence values for the
  workstreams (not all 0.85).
     e. Confirmation that the quality gate logs appear in the console for the
  standard journey.

  3. DO NOT MOVE FORWARD UNTIL ALL OF THE ABOVE ARTIFACTS ARE PROVIDED.
     These evidence items are the gate for Tasks 3-5 on the standard path.

  Summary of Missing Evidence:
  - `resources.csv` (standard journey) with decimal FTEs   [REQUIRED]
  - Console log showing normalization + quality gate result [REQUIRED]
  - `benefits.csv` with names/targets (standard journey)    [REQUIRED]
  - Confidence variation proof (standard journey)          [REQUIRED]
  - Quality gate log from the standard journey             [REQUIRED]

  Report back ONLY when all of these have been implemented and attached.
