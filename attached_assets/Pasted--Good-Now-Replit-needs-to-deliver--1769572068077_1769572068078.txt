 Good. Now Replit needs to deliver:                                            
                                                                                
  1. The actual scripts/regression-test.ts file - Show the code                 
  2. Run it and show baseline results - Screenshot or output showing which      
  transitions pass/fail                                                         
                                                                                
  We expect to see something like:

  This baseline is our "before" snapshot. After fixing T002, we run again and   
  verify:                                                                       
  - T002 now passes                                                             
  - T001 and T003 still pass (no regression)                                    
                                                                                
  Ask Replit to show the test script code and run it now.
