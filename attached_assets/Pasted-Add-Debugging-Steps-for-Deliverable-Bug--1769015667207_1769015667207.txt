Add: Debugging Steps for Deliverable Bug                                      
                                                                                
  Step 1: Add logging to trace deliverable source                               
                                                                                
  In server/intelligence/epm-synthesizer.ts, find the generateWorkstreams or    
  generateDeliverables function and add:                                        
                                                                                
  console.log('[DEBUG] Generating deliverables for workstream:',                
  workstream.name);                                                             
  console.log('[DEBUG] Source data:', JSON.stringify(sourceData, null,          
  2).slice(0, 500));                                                            
                                                                                
  Step 2: Search for suspicious patterns                                        
                                                                                
  # Find where deliverables array is populated                                  
  grep -rn "deliverables.*=" server/intelligence/                               
  grep -rn "deliverables\.push\|deliverables\s*:" server/intelligence/          
                                                                                
  # Find where BMC block content might leak into deliverables                   
  grep -rn "channels\|customer_relationships\|research"                         
  server/intelligence/epm-synthesizer.ts                                        
                                                                                
  Step 3: Check the WBS builder output                                          
                                                                                
  The deliverables might be coming from the WBS builder. In                     
  src/lib/intelligent-planning/wbs-builder/:                                    
                                                                                
  // Add logging in wbs-builder.ts or wbs-pipeline.ts                           
  console.log('[WBS] Workstream deliverables:', ws.deliverables);               
                                                                                
  Step 4: Verify with a minimal test                                            
                                                                                
  After fixing, test with a simple input and verify deliverables make sense:    
  Workstream: "Site selection and lease negotiation"                            
  Expected deliverable: "Signed Lease Agreement" or "Location Analysis Report"  
  NOT: "Dubai restaurants reach customers through multi-channel approach..."
