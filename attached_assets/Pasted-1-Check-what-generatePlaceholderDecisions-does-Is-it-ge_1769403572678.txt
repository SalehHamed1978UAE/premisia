1. Check what generatePlaceholderDecisions does                               
  Is it generating REAL decisions based on the SWOT output, or just             
  placeholder/mock decisions? The DecisionPage should show AI-generated options 
  based on the actual analysis.                                                 
                                                                                
  2. Verify results are in frameworkInsights                                    
  After SWOT runs, check:                                                       
  SELECT * FROM framework_insights ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;            
  The SWOT output should be saved there, not just in aggregatedOutputs.         
                                                                                
  3. Data flow concern                                                          
  Replit created strategy_versions records to satisfy DecisionPage. This works, 
  but means we now have data in TWO places:                                     
  - customJourneyExecutions.aggregatedOutputs (SWOT output)                     
  - strategy_versions (created for DecisionPage)                                
                                                                                
  Long-term this should be unified, but for now it's acceptable as a workaround.
                                                                                
  4. Ask Replit to confirm:                                                     
  - Does the DecisionPage show REAL decision options based on SWOT analysis?    
  - Or is it showing placeholder/mock decisions?                                
                                                                                
  The goal is: SWOT analysis → feeds into → AI-generated decision options → user
   selects → feeds into EPM.                                                    
                                                                                
  If generatePlaceholderDecisions is just creating fake data, we need to wire up
   the actual DecisionGenerator to create options from the SWOT output.
