Good. Now execute and show results:                                           
                                                                                
  1. Write the file - scripts/regression-test.ts                                
  2. Run it - Show terminal output                                              
  3. Then add T002-async - A test that actually triggers the journey flow       
                                                                                
  We need to see the actual output:

  Then T002-async should FAIL - proving the race condition exists before we fix 
  it.                                                                           
                                                                                
  Ask Replit to run the tests now and paste the output.
