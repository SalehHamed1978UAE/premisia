Here’s exactly what we need—please follow this list so “Start New Journey”
  behaves with reuse instead of kicking users back to the raw input screen:

  ———

  ### Restore the button and label

  - On the Strategy detail page, the button next to the title must be “Start New
    Journey” (not “New Strategy” or anything else).
  - Clicking it should not navigate away immediately.

  ### Launch the Journey modal instead of redirecting

  - Keep the existing “Start New Journey” button wired to the Journey Launcher
    modal (the one we planned in Phase 4).
  - Opening the modal should pull context from the current understandingId.
    Show what’s already available (entity count, reference count, previous
    frameworks, etc.).

  ### Journey options in the modal

  - Modal needs two paths (same interface we specced):
      1. Run a full journey – user chooses a journey type.
      2. Run a single framework – user picks one or more frameworks.
  - For each choice, call POST /api/journeys/check-readiness with the current
    understandingId and the selected journey/framework. Use the result to decide
    whether we can run immediately or need more info.

  ### If ready to run

  - When the readiness API returns ready, give the user the option to “Start in
    Background” (call the background execution API and close the modal).
  - In parallel, drop a toast like “Journey queued – you’ll get a notification
    when it’s done.”

  ### If more input is required

  - Show the missing items in the modal (e.g., “Need pricing clarification”)
    along with buttons/links to gather that input.
  - If running immediately is still useful (user is willing to supply info
    manually), the modal can offer a “Continue in Journey Builder” button.

  ### When we do need manual input

  - Navigating into the Strategic Consultant should happen only if the readiness
    check says We need more input.
  - The link should be to "/strategic-consultant/journey-selection/
    ${understandingId}" (or the full wizard route), not the raw input page.
  - In that flow, preload the stored strategic input and clarifications so the
    user doesn’t have to re-type anything.

  ### Ensure context reuse

  - Any time /strategic-consultant/... is opened with an understandingId,
    automatically load the existing understanding (title, text, clarifications,
    document extracts).
  - Hide or disable the raw text area when context is already present; show “You
    are continuing the strategy: <title>”.

  ### Summary of acceptance criteria

  - Button label back to “Start New Journey”.
  - Modal opens with current strategy context.
  - Readiness check runs for both journeys and single frameworks.
  - If ready, allow background start (no redirection).
  - If not ready, list what’s missing and link to the right part of the wizard.
  - If we redirect into the Strategic Consultant flow, it must land on journey
    selection with all prior inputs loaded.

  Once this is implemented, users can truly kick off new journeys or single
  frameworks using existing context without being dumped into the blank input
  form.
