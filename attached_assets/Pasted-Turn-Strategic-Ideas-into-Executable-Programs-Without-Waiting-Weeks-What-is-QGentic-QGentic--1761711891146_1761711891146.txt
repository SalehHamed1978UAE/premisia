Turn Strategic Ideas into Executable Programs — Without Waiting Weeks

  What is QGentic?
  QGentic is an AI‑enhanced strategic intelligence platform that takes
  you from “we should do this” to a complete, execution‑ready Enterprise
  Program Management (EPM) plan. Think of it as an on‑demand team of strategy
  consultants, researchers, and program managers that translates your insight
  into a roadmap you can launch.

  ### Why leaders pick QGentic

  Multi-agent AI built for strategy
  QGentic isn’t a chatbot. A coordinated set of agents handles each stage:

  - Executive Agent – tests assumptions and frames the problem
  - Builder Specialist – converts insight into workstreams, timelines, and
    resources
  - QA Specialist – stress-tests feasibility, finds contradictions, plugs gaps
  - Research Agent – runs real-time web research with source validation
  - Smart Orchestrator – routes tasks across OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini for
    reliability

  Battle-tested frameworks, guided from end to end

  - Five Whys with automated quality checkpoints
  - Business Model Canvas with evidence-backed market and competitor insights
  - PESTLE and Porter’s Five Forces for external forces and competitive dynamics
  - Custom journeys that chain frameworks to fit your use case

  Complete EPM programs in about an hour
  Every journey ends with a 14-component execution blueprint:

  - Executive summary and success criteria
  - Workstreams with deliverables and dependencies
  - Critical-path timeline and stage gates
  - Resource plan, workload checks, and conflict alerts
  - Financial projections and cash-flow schedule
  - Risk register with mitigations
  - KPI framework, governance, QA, procurement, exit strategy, and more

  Built-in scheduling and optimization keeps tasks sequenced, resources
  balanced, and critical path highlighted.

  ### Features that deliver board-ready outputs

  - Smart Document Intelligence – upload PDFs, Word docs, spreadsheets, or
    images; QGentic extracts the insight and enriches a secure knowledge graph
    so you never lose context.
  - Anti-bias research – the system challenges your assumptions, surfaces
    contradictory evidence, and flags missing proof.
  - Evidence-based recommendations – every insight is linked to sources and
    rationale.
  - Professional exports – generate both standard and UI-styled reports in PDF,
    Word, Markdown, plus data bundles (JSON, CSV) inside a single ZIP.
  - Knowledge graph – build institutional memory with encrypted insight storage.

  ### How long does it take?

  - First run: expect 45–60 minutes to complete the guided frameworks, run
    market validation, and generate the EPM program.
  - Repeat runs: 30–45 minutes once you’re familiar and QGentic has context.
    Traditional consulting workflow: 2–3 weeks of research, meetings, and manual
    assembly.

  QGentic = one working session instead of one month.

  ### Security and reliability built in

  - AES-256 encryption, role-based access control, and OIDC authentication
  - PostgreSQL + Neon/Drizzle storage
  - Version management so you can compare iterations and keep audits
