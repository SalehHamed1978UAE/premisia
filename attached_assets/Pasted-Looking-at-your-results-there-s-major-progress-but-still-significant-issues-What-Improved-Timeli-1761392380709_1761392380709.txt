Looking at your results, there's major progress but still significant issues:
What Improved:

Timeline reduced from 166 months to 22 months (much better!)
Context is flowing through: Business context: general_business (smb), Timeline range: 6-12 months
Real AI calls happening (33s + 16s + 18s etc)

The New Problems:
1. Still Too Long:
Generated 22 months when told 6-12 months range
2. Wrong Type of Tasks:
The AI thinks you're building SOFTWARE for a coffee shop, not OPENING a coffee shop:

"Inventory Management System Design"
"Staff Scheduling System Development"
"CRM System Implementation"
"Technology Platform Development"

These are IT projects, not coffee shop opening tasks!
3. Bizarre Overlaps:
The Gantt shows 7000% confidence on overlapping critical tasks that make no logical sense
The Root Cause:
The AI is misunderstanding the fundamental business case. It thinks:

❌ "Build software systems for coffee shops"
✅ Should be: "Open a coffee shop in Brooklyn"

Tell Replit:

The context is working but the AI misunderstands the business case
Progress made:

22 months instead of 166 ✅
Context propagation working ✅

New problem:
The AI thinks we're building SOFTWARE for coffee shops, not OPENING a coffee shop. That's why all tasks are "System Design" and "System Development".
The fix:
In the prompt, be explicit about what's being planned:
typescript// In task-extractor.ts
const prompt = `
You are planning to: ${context.business.description || 'OPEN and OPERATE a coffee shop'}
This is about LAUNCHING the business, not building software for it.
...
`;
Also check:
Why is it showing "general_business" instead of detecting "coffee_shop" or "retail_food_service"?
The 22-month timeline makes sense if you're building 5 software systems. But for opening a coffee shop, it should be:

Location scouting (1-2 months)
Permits & licensing (2-3 months)
Build-out & equipment (2-3 months)
Hiring & training (1 month)
Soft opening (1 month)
Total: 6-9 months

The context detection needs to be clearer about the actual business objective.
