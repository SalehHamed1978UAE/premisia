 Two SSE bugs to fix:                                                          
                                                                                
  Bug 1: Progress jumps backwards (71% → 58%)                                   
                                                                                
  Each stage is calculating its own 0-100% instead of a global monotonic        
  percent. Fix:                                                                 
                                                                                
  // Define fixed boundaries for each stage                                     
  const STAGE_RANGES = {                                                        
    workstreams: { start: 0, end: 30 },                                         
    tasks: { start: 30, end: 55 },                                              
    schedule: { start: 55, end: 75 },                                           
    resources: { start: 75, end: 90 },                                          
    finalize: { start: 90, end: 100 }                                           
  };                                                                            
                                                                                
  // Always calculate global percent like this:                                 
  const globalPercent = STAGE_RANGES[stage].start +                             
    (stageProgress * (STAGE_RANGES[stage].end - STAGE_RANGES[stage].start));    
                                                                                
  Progress must ONLY go up, never down.                                         
                                                                                
  Bug 2: Sub-task list never updates (all stay on clock icons)                  
                                                                                
  The SSE events only send percent and message. The frontend needs step and     
  status to update the sub-task list.                                           
                                                                                
  Change events from:                                                           
  { percent: 45, message: 'Extracting tasks...' }                               
                                                                                
  To:                                                                           
  {                                                                             
    percent: 45,                                                                
    message: 'Extracting tasks...',                                             
    step: 'tasks',           // Which step: 'workstreams' | 'tasks' | 'schedule'
   | 'resources' | 'finalize'                                                   
    status: 'active'         // Status: 'pending' | 'active' | 'complete'       
  }                                                                             
                                                                                
  Then frontend updates the sub-task list:                                      
  setStepStatuses(prev => ({ ...prev, [payload.step]: payload.status }));
