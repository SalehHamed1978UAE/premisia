You're right - this is a critical inconsistency.
The system is contradicting itself:
In Porter's Analysis (working correctly):

"Contested research suggests... 95%... though this data is disputed and may not reflect current market conditions"

In Decision Recommendations (broken):

"❌ Not Recommended - High risk approach - contradicts research showing 95% of generative AI pilots fail"

This is using contested, weak evidence as authoritative proof to reject an entire strategic option.

Tell Replit:
"There's a critical bug in decision generation. The system correctly identifies the '95% AI pilots fail' claim as contested/weak in Porter's analysis, but then uses that SAME weak claim as definitive evidence to mark 'Broad AI Capabilities Platform' as ❌ Not Recommended.
The problem:

Validation system marks claim as 🔴 WEAK
Porter's analysis correctly qualifies it as "disputed"
BUT decision generator treats it as 🟢 STRONG evidence to reject strategies

Fix required:
The decision generator must respect validation results. When generating decisions:
typescript// WRONG (current):
if (finding.mentions('95% failure')) {
  markAsNotRecommended('High risk - research shows 95% fail');
}

// CORRECT:
if (finding.mentions('95% failure') && finding.validation.strength === 'WEAK') {
  // Don't use weak evidence as basis for rejection
  // Or qualify it: 'Some contested research suggests high risk, but evidence is disputed'
}
The decision logic should:

Check validation strength before using claims as evidence
🟢 STRONG claims → use as primary evidence
🟡 MODERATE claims → use with caveats
🔴 WEAK claims → DO NOT use as primary rejection criteria

Expected behavior for this case:
Since the 95% claim is WEAK/contested, the decision should say:
'Broad AI Capabilities Platform: ⚠️ Approach with caution
While some research suggests high AI pilot failure rates, this data is contested and may reflect poor implementation rather than inherent risk. Success depends on: [factors]'
NOT: '❌ Not Recommended - contradicts research showing 95% fail'
The system is validating claims correctly but then ignoring its own validation when making recommendations. This undermines the entire validation system.
