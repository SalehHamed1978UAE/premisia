Great—here’s the current status of the repo and the next actions:

  1. Multi-Agent Service
      - CrewAI agent-planner is running and healthy (/health returns status
        healthy, 7 agents).
      - USE_MULTI_AGENT_EPM=true means the next EPM generation will use the
        multi-agent workflow; if the service goes down, the legacy generator
        still kicks in because EPM_FALLBACK_ON_ERROR=true.
  2. Journey Guardrails Still Missing
      - docs/JOURNEY_ARCHITECTURE.md doesn’t exist yet.
      - REPLIT.md has no warning banner.
      - ResearchPage.tsx lacks the comment banner instructing devs to use
        getJourneyByType/getNextPage.
      - package.json doesn’t have test:journeys or test:architecture.
      - tests/journeys/journey-architecture.spec.ts is missing.

     Without these, it’s easy for BMI to regress. Please add those files exactly
     per the instructions we shared earlier (they’re summarized in
     attached_assets/Pasted-Add-Journey-Architecture-
     Guardrails--1768926431552_1768926431553.txt).

     Summary of what to do:
      - Create /docs/JOURNEY_ARCHITECTURE.md.
      - Add the warning block at the top of REPLIT.md.
      - Insert the multi-line warning comment at the top of client/src/pages/
        strategic-consultant/ResearchPage.tsx.
      - Add the scripts:

        "scripts": {
          ...
          "test:journeys": "npx jest tests/journeys/ --passWithNoTests",
          "test:architecture": "npx jest tests/journeys/journey-
  architecture.spec.ts"
        }
      - Create tests/journeys/journey-architecture.spec.ts with the integrity
        checks from the instructions.
      - Run npm run test:journeys once to confirm the new test suite passes.
  3. Next steps
      - Once the guardrails are in, rerun BMI→EPM to validate the new multi-
        agent plan.
      - Start refining the EPM output (cleaner deliverables, benefits/KPIs,
        etc.).

  Let me know when those guardrail files are added or if you need any of the
  text from the instructions copied over.
