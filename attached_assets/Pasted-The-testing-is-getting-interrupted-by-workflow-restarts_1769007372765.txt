The testing is getting interrupted by workflow restarts. A few issues:        
                                                                                
  1. Workflow instability - Keeps restarting, killing long-running tests        
  2. Python stdout buffering - Logs not appearing immediately                   
  3. Test timeout - 7-round generation needs 10-15 minutes                      
                                                                                
  Suggested approach for Replit:                                                
                                                                                
  1. Add Python flush - In main.py and program_crew.py:                         
  import sys                                                                    
  print("[CrewAI] ...", flush=True)                                             
  # Or at top of file:                                                          
  sys.stdout.reconfigure(line_buffering=True)                                   
  2. Run test outside workflow - Use a separate terminal/process that won't get 
  killed:                                                                       
  nohup curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/generate-program \                   
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \                                       
    -d '{"businessContext": {...}, "bmcInsights": {...}, "userId": "test"}' \   
    > /tmp/crewai-test.json 2>&1 &                                              
  3. Check result after 15 min - Don't keep restarting the workflow             
  4. Neo4j - Update or remove the stale NEO4J_URI secret if the Aura instance no
   longer exists. It's non-critical but noisy.                                  
                                                                                
  The core fix is working (we saw agents running earlier). The challenge is     
  completing a full test without interruption.
