Perfect diagnosis. The bug is clear:
Porter's Analyzer: Sends findings WITH validation → LLM qualifies claims → ✅ Works correctly
Decision Generator: Sends findings WITHOUT validation → LLM treats all claims as facts → ❌ Uses weak evidence to reject strategies
Your fix is correct. Implement it with one refinement:
In the prompt instructions (after line 211), make it even more explicit:
CRITICAL VALIDATION RULES:

🔴 WEAK EVIDENCE HANDLING:
- NEVER use WEAK evidence as the PRIMARY reason to mark options as "❌ Not Recommended"
- If a strategic option conflicts with WEAK evidence, mark it as "⚠️ Requires validation" or "Approach with caution"
- In the reasoning field, explicitly state: "This recommendation is based on contested data [citation]. Further validation recommended before commitment."

Example (WRONG):
Finding: "95% AI pilots fail [WEAK: Single 2021 source, contradicted by recent studies]"
Decision: ❌ Not Recommended - High risk based on 95% failure rate

Example (CORRECT):
Finding: "95% AI pilots fail [WEAK: Single 2021 source, contradicted by recent studies]"
Decision: ⚠️ Approach with caution - Earlier studies suggested high failure rates, but this data is contested. Recent evidence shows 53-67% success rates with proper implementation. Recommend pilot program with clear success metrics.

🟡 MODERATE EVIDENCE:
- Use as supporting evidence, but acknowledge limitations
- Example: "Research suggests X [MODERATE: 2 sources, 18 months old], though conditions may have evolved"

🟢 STRONG EVIDENCE:
- Use confidently as primary decision basis
- Multiple recent sources, no contradictions
After implementing, test with the same AI build vs buy scenario. The 'Broad AI Capabilities Platform' decision should change from:
BEFORE: ❌ Not Recommended - contradicts research showing 95% fail
TO: ⚠️ Requires careful planning - While some research suggests high failure rates [WEAK evidence], recent data shows improving success rates. Recommend phased approach with clear metrics and pilot validation before full commitment.
