Exactly the issue I identified. The architecture is correct but the routes    
  bypass it.                                                                    
                                                                                
  The fix:                                                                      
                                                                                
  // In strategy-workspace.ts                                                   
  // Change from:                                                               
  import { EPMSynthesizer } from '../intelligence/epm-synthesizer';             
  const synthesizer = new EPMSynthesizer();                                     
  const result = await synthesizer.generate(...);                               
                                                                                
  // To:                                                                        
  import { generateEPM } from '../intelligence/epm-generator-router';           
  const result = await generateEPM(context, decisions, ...);                    
  // Router checks USE_MULTI_AGENT_EPM and routes accordingly                   
                                                                                
  The task list looks right:                                                    
  1. Update route to use new generator                                          
  2. Check generator input/output matches routes                                
  3. Test EPM generation, check metadata                                        
  4. Verify exported data includes conversation logs                            
                                                                                
  Key verification: After the fix, EPM output should include generator:         
  "multi-agent" metadata.                                                       
                                                                                
  Go ahead with the fix.
