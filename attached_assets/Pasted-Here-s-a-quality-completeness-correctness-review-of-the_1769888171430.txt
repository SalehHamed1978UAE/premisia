Here’s a quality/completeness/correctness review of the export package in /
  Users/salehyahyahamed/Downloads/Opening-Traditional-Cafe-in-Dubai-Business-
  District v1.zip. Findings first, ordered by severity.

  Findings

  - Critical — Decisions are missing entirely
      - data/strategy.json has 0 decisions, which means the strategic decision
        layer is empty. This is a core output of the journey.
      - Path: /tmp/premisia_review/data/strategy.json
  - Critical — Assignments/RACI are empty
      - data/assignments.csv only contains the header row (no assignments).
      - data/epm.json shows assignments array length = 0.
      - This makes the EPM execution plan incomplete (no ownership at task
        level).
      - Paths: /tmp/premisia_review/data/assignments.csv, /tmp/premisia_review/
        data/epm.json
  - High — Risk register is incomplete
      - Risk Owner is - for all entries.
      - Severity column is - (not computed).
      - Probability is a raw “15” (no unit/scale), while Impact is “Low/High”;
        inconsistent scale.
      - Path: /tmp/premisia_review/data/risks.csv
  - High — Benefits are generic or mismatched
      - Example: “Market Position → Corporate Catering Market” doesn’t match a
        traditional cafe.
      - Benefits are few (only 4), and none are financial/cost or customer
        experience benefits.
      - Path: /tmp/premisia_review/data/benefits.csv
  - Medium — Resource roles don’t match the business
      - Roles like Corporate Sales Manager and Catering Operations Manager are
        not typical for a traditional cafe.
      - Missing expected roles (Cafe Manager, Baristas, FOH staff, Procurement,
        Compliance).
      - Path: /tmp/premisia_review/data/resources.csv
  - Medium — Workstreams appear to overlap or duplicate scope
      - “Cafe Infrastructure Development & Setup” includes POS + inventory, yet
        “Cafe Technology Systems Setup” is a separate workstream.
      - This is likely a scope overlap and could cause duplication in execution.
      - Path: /tmp/premisia_review/data/workstreams.csv
  - Medium — Timeline/Progress inconsistencies
      - Gantt image shows % completion, but CSVs don’t provide task-level
        progress or assignments to justify progress tracking.
      - Suggest either populate progress fields or remove % visuals.

  Completeness Summary

  - Core EPM components exist (executive summary, workstreams, timeline, etc.),
    but Decision output and Assignments are missing, which are essential for
    execution readiness.
  - Risk register and benefits are partially populated but not production‑ready.

  Next Steps to Bring This to “Correct + Complete”

  1. Fix SWOT → Decisions bridge so strategy.json gets real decisions.
  2. Ensure Decision → EPM persists assignments (RACI/ownership).
  3. Populate Risk owners + Severity calculation.
  4. Update resource roles to match a traditional cafe context.
  5. De‑duplicate scope between Infrastructure vs Technology workstreams.

  If you want, I can generate a short “quality checklist” that you can run on
  every export package, and I can also map each fix to the exact server module
  that produces it.
