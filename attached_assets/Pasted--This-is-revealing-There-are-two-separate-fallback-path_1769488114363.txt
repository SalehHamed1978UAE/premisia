 This is revealing. There are two separate fallback paths, and we only removed 
  one:                                                                          
                                                                                
  WBS Builder → Generates 6 real workstreams ✅                                 
          ↓                                                                     
  Intelligent Planning (Task Extraction) → Times out after 66s ❌               
          ↓                                                                     
  "FORCING SUCCESS for testing" ⚠️  ← This is a hack someone added              
          ↓                                                                     
  Falls back to "legacy synthesis path"                                         
          ↓                                                                     
  Legacy path REGENERATES workstreams from scratch                              
          ↓                                                                     
  "Capitalize on:" garbage overwrites the good WBS output                       
                                                                                
  The problem: WBS Builder output is being thrown away when a later step fails. 
                                                                                
  Why this happened: Someone added FORCING SUCCESS for testing which masks the  
  failure but then triggers the legacy path anyway. This is technical debt from 
  testing that was never cleaned up.                                            
                                                                                
  The fix is straightforward:                                                   
                                                                                
  1. Preserve WBS Builder output - Store it before intelligent planning runs    
  2. If planning fails, use WBS workstreams anyway - Skip timeline optimization,
   but keep real workstreams                                                    
  3. Remove the legacy regeneration path entirely - It should never regenerate  
  workstreams from scratch                                                      
                                                                                
  Tell Replit: Yes, fix this. But make sure they:                               
                                                                                
  1. Delete the "FORCING SUCCESS for testing" hack - this is hiding real        
  failures                                                                      
  2. Delete the legacy synthesis path that regenerates workstreams - it's the   
  source of garbage                                                             
  3. Ensure WBS Builder output flows through regardless of planning step success
                                                                                
  The architecture should be:                                                   
  WBS Builder → workstreams (saved)                                             
          ↓                                                                     
  Intelligent Planning → timeline/dependencies (optional enhancement)           
          ↓                                                                     
  If planning fails → use workstreams as-is, log warning                        
          ↓                                                                     
  Save workstreams (never regenerate)                                           
                                                                                
  The fact that it was "the fastest journey" suggests the timeout is happening  
  quickly and falling back immediately, rather than actually running the full   
  pipeline.
