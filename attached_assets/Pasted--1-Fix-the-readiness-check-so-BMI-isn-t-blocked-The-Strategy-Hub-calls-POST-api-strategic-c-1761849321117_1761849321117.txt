 ### 1. Fix the readiness check so BMI isn’t blocked

  The Strategy Hub calls POST /api/strategic-consultant/journeys/check-
  readiness. That handler still uses the default minimums (3 references, 5
  entities), which trips BMI every time you run it from the hub. Update the
  readiness logic in server/routes/strategic-consultant.ts so it’s journey-
  aware:

  const readinessConfig: Record<string, { minReferences: number; minEntities:
  number }> = {
    business_model_innovation: { minReferences: 0, minEntities: 0 },
    // leave other journeys with the default thresholds for now
  };

  const { minReferences, minEntities } = readinessConfig[journeyType as
  string] ?? {
    minReferences: 3,
    minEntities: 5,
  };

  Use those minReferences / minEntities when you calculate isReady and when
  you build the “missing requirements” list. This will stop “Need 3 more
  reference(s)” from appearing when you have enough context to run BMI.

  ### 2. Restore the ambiguity workflow in the journey path

  handleJourneyStepSubmit in client/src/pages/strategic-consultant/InputPage.tsx
  now calls the ambiguity check, but the results aren’t stored correctly:

  - When hasAmbiguities is true, capture the trimmed input before showing the
    modal (e.g. setText(trimmedInput);).
  - In handleClarificationsSubmit, if you’re in journey mode, rebuild
    the clarified input exactly the way the standard path does (use
    ambiguityDetector.buildClarifiedInput on the server, or reconstruct the text
    client-side) and pass it into startJourneyUnderstanding.
  - Persist the answered clarifications in localStorage or on the understanding
    record so subsequent runs know they’ve been resolved.

  Without that, the modal either never opens or the clarifications aren’t
  applied when you advance the journey.

  ### 3. Stop re-running the raw baseline input

  Right now “Run Additional Analysis” just replays the original statement, which
  produces the same outputs. Instead, before you launch a follow-on journey:

  1. Assemble a summary of the completed strategy (executive summary, key
     insights, major decisions).
  2. Use that summary as the input for startJourneyUnderstanding (or pass it to
     the backend when you call /understanding).
  3. Mark in the understanding record that this run was derived from version N
     so you keep the audit trail.

  That way every new journey works off the latest strategic state, not the raw
  first draft.

  ### 4. Bonus: better error messaging for missing Brave keys

  If BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY isn’t set, the current /api/web-search implementation
  just throws and the SSE dies. Wrap it with a user-friendly fallback:

  if (!apiKey) {
    console.warn('Brave Search API key missing');
    return res.status(503).json({
      error: 'Search service unavailable',
      message: 'Add BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY to enable web research.',
    });
  }

  This keeps the UI consistent and tells us exactly what’s wrong.
