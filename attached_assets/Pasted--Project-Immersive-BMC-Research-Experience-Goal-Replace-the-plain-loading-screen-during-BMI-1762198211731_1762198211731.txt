 ### Project: Immersive BMC Research Experience

  Goal: Replace the plain loading screen during BMI/BMC research with a rich,
  animated interface that keeps users engaged and informed while the research
  runs.

  Key features to build:

  1. Animated background & theme
      - Softly moving geometric patterns (SVG/WebGL) with BMI colors.
      - Lightweight animation (Framer Motion or similar) with reduced-motion
        fallback.
  2. Progress timeline
      - Horizontal (or circular) timeline showing phases such as:
          - Generating queries
          - Collecting sources
          - Extracting evidence
          - Validating contradictions
          - Synthesizing insights
          - Preparing summary
      - Each phase lights up with an animation when active and shows status
        text.
  3. Live insight cards
      - As SSE updates arrive, display animated cards (slide in/out) with:
          - Category (market dynamics, competitive landscape…)
          - Headline, summary, confidence
          - “Sources consulted” or similar details
      - Use AnimatePresence or similar for smooth entrance/exit.
  4. Context stats
      - Sidebar or widgets showing counters (sources scanned, articles analyzed,
        contradictions flagged).
      - Counters increment smoothly as progress updates come in.
  5. Narrative beats
      - Small text callouts when something interesting happens (e.g., “Top
        keyword: artisan cafe”).
      - Driven by existing SSE messages.
  6. Controls
      - “Skip animation” / reduce motion toggle (respect user prefers-reduced-
        motion).
      - Ensure accessible (aria-live updates, keyboard navigation).
  7. Fallback mode
      - If animations fail or user opts out, fall back to current simple loader
        with progress bar.

  Technical requirements:

  - Create a ResearchExperience component that subscribes to the existing SSE
    endpoints.
  - Map SSE events to phases and insight queues.
  - Keep CPU/GPU usage light; throttle animation when tab is inactive.
  - Write snapshot/tests to ensure the progress state renders correctly.

  Deliverables:

  1. High-level mockup or visual reference for approval.
  2. Implementation of the animated experience in the BMI research flow.
  3. Tests (unit or integration) verifying the new UI handles progress updates.
  4. Documentation/walkthrough so future journeys can reuse the component.
