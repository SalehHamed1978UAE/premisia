 Golden Records Admin UI Implementation Instructions

  We need the Golden Records dashboard, but it must be invisible to regular
  users. Please build the UI inside the existing app with the following
  constraints:

  1. Routing
      - Mount the admin experience under /admin/golden-records (and sub-routes
        like /admin/golden-records/:journeyType/:version and /admin/golden-
        records/:journeyType/:version/compare).
      - Do not expose these routes in the public sidebar/top-nav; only admins
        with the direct URL should reach them.
  2. Client-Side Guard
      - Before rendering any admin component, check the signed-in user’s role/
        feature flag. We already have admin roles available—reuse the same
        logic we use elsewhere (e.g., requireRole(['Admin']) equivalent on the
        client).
      - If the user is not an admin, immediately redirect to a safe page or show
        an “Access denied” message.
  3. Server-Side Protection
      - All new API calls already go through requireRole(['Admin']). Keep using
        those endpoints; no additional server wiring needed.
  4. UI Features to Implement
      - Journey list view showing each journey type, current version badge, last
        updated timestamp, and a link to its timeline.
      - Version timeline per journey with promote/clone/download actions.
      - Version detail page displaying each step: screenshots, expected URLs,
        sanitized payloads, DB snapshots, notes.
      - Compare view with side-by-side diffs (highlight changed URLs and payload
        differences; for screenshots, let admins flip between versions).
      - Capture form (for later) will live here, so add a placeholder “Capture
        Golden Record” button that calls the existing API.
  5. Screenshot handling
      - For now, allow manual upload via the admin form and store files at
        golden-records/<journeyType>/v<version>/<step>.png using the existing
        asset pipeline. Save the path in steps[].screenshotPath.
  6. Testing
      - Verify a non-admin account cannot access /admin/golden-records (client
        guard + server 403).
      - As an admin, walk through the list → timeline → detail → compare and hit
        the API endpoints to ensure everything renders properly.

  Once the admin UI is in place, we’ll integrate the capture workflow and
  regression CLI.
