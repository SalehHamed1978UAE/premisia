The export is wiring up correctly, but the Markdown/DOCX generators are still
  using placeholder blocks—so you end up with a header, a couple of fields, and
  nothing else. Also, the ZIP/file names stay generic (qgentic-export-session-…)
  instead of using the artifact title. Please ask Replit to make the following
  adjustments:

  ———

  ### 1. Populate the Markdown report with full content

  In generateMarkdown:

  - Pull data from the export package and render the full set of sections. At
    minimum:
      - Executive summary (objectives, success factors, confidence).
      - Strategic analysis (framework type, insights, contradictions, decisions,
        maybe trend analysis if present).
      - Workstreams & deliverables (loop through pkg.epm.program.workstreams
        with start/end months, deliverables).
      - Timeline (total months, critical path list, stage gates).
      - Resource plan (internal team, external resources, critical skills).
      - Financial plan (total budget, breakdown, cash flow).
      - Benefits, risks, KPIs, stakeholders, governance, QA plan, procurement,
        exit strategy—pull these from the corresponding properties in the JSON.
      - Task assignments (table from pkg.epm.assignments).
  - Use Markdown tables where appropriate (risks, assignments), and guard
    everything with optional chaining so missing sections are handled
    gracefully.
  - If there’s no EPM program (analysis only), omit the EPM sections but still
    render the strategic summary.

  The JSON already has the data, so this is just formatting it into Markdown
  instead of leaving placeholders.

  ### 2. Generate DOCX from the same content

  Currently generateDOCX only writes the title and short summary. Either:

  - Compose DOCX sections programmatically using the same loops as in Markdown,
    or
  - Use a helper (e.g. markdown-to-docx) to convert the Markdown string into a
    DOCX document.

  Whichever route they choose, the entire report should be represented—the DOCX
  shouldn’t stop after the executive summary.

  ### 3. PDF from Markdown/HTML

  If they aren’t already, convert Markdown to HTML with a parser
  (marked.parse(markdown) or similar) before feeding it to Puppeteer. That
  ensures headings, bold text, and tables render correctly. (Simple string
  replacement of \n with <br> won’t work.)

  ### 4. Name the output files based on the artifact

  - When a program is available, use the program’s name (sanitized for
    filenames) plus version for the ZIP and inside files (e.g. coffee-shop-
    launch-v1/report.pdf).
  - When exporting only the analysis, use the strategic understanding title or
    session name.
  - Update the download logic in ExportFullReportButton so the suggested
    filename matches the artifact title (not the session ID).

  ### 5. Verify

  Ask Replit to run an export on a program and confirm:

  - report.md contains all sections with real data (not just the intro).
  - report.docx mirrors the same content (open it in Word/Google Docs to
    confirm).
  - report.pdf shows headings, tables, and section bodies.
  - JSON/CSV already look correct, so those should remain unchanged.
  - The ZIP and file names reflect the artifact’s name/version.
