That's a clear bug. The flow should be:                                       
                                                                                
  Custom Journey Created (PESTLE → Porter's → SWOT → Strategic Decisions)       
       ↓                                                                        
  Click custom journey → Strategic Consultant starts                            
       ↓                                                                        
  Enter "Open Chinese restaurant in Dubai"                                      
       ↓

       ↓                                                                        
  ✗ WRONG: Goes to "Select Your Journey" (pre-built journeys)                   
  ✓ SHOULD: Go to PESTLE (first module in YOUR custom journey)                  
                                                                                
  The Problem:                                                                  
  After the input processor (Strategic Consultant) completes, the system doesn't
   know it's running a custom journey. It defaults to the standard flow which   
  shows the journey selection page.

  Bug: Custom journey execution doesn't continue to next module                 
                                                                                
  Steps to reproduce:                                                           
  1. Create custom journey in Journey Builder (e.g., PESTLE → Porter's → SWOT)  
  2. Go to journeys list, click on custom journey                               
  3. Strategic Consultant starts correctly                                      
  4. Enter business idea, answer ambiguities                                    
  5. Bug: Redirects to "Select Your Journey" instead of continuing to PESTLE    
                                                                                
  Expected: After input processing, continue to the next module defined in the  
  custom journey (PESTLE), not the journey selection page.                      
                                                                                
  The journey session needs to track which custom journey config it belongs to  
  and route to the next module in that config.                                  
                                                                                
  This is a routing/state issue - the session loses track of which custom       
  journey it's executing.
