Observations on the EPM output:

  1. Timeline correctness – The regenerated plan now has eight proper
     workstreams with overlaps, deliverables, and confidence variation (mostly
     85%). This is a big improvement over the linear “Capitalize on…” ladder we
     were seeing before.
  2. Naming mismatch – The exported ZIP uses the correct title (“Premium Sneaker
     Store Launch Abu Dhabi”), but the EPM program record inside the app still
     shows the old session label. That suggests the program name is being
     populated from a default template instead of the strategy title when the
     record is created. Replit needs to ensure the same naming field (probably
     the strategy title) is used for both the DB record and the export.

  Once they normalize the naming source, the UI should match the ZIP filename.
  Let them know the timeline looks good now; the remaining bug is the
  inconsistent program name.

  these issues weren’t resolved:

  1. EPM Title bug – The screenshot clearly shows an AI-generated generic title
     (“Premium Sneaker Store Launch Abu Dhabi”), but the UI still labels it with
     an old session name (“Retail Outlet Construction & Setup”). We need Replit
     to trace where the EPM program name is set (likely during epm_programs
     insert) and ensure it pulls from the journey/strategy title instead of an
     AI placeholder.
  2. Wrong workstream content – Even though WBS Builder now preserves its
     output, it’s generating food-service workstreams (“Food Safety Legal
     Compliance,” etc.) for a sneaker store. That means the inputs the builder
     is consuming are still tied to a previous journey (likely the café
     session). Ask Replit to verify:
      - Which framework_insights rows are being fed into WBS Builder for this
        new session?
      - Are they actually coming from the sneaker journey, or did the builder
        reuse cached data? They need to log the context passed to WBS Builder to
        ensure it contains the new business description.
  3. Timeline still 12 months – The code change in timeline-calculator.ts won’t
     help existing records, but this program was generated after the fix and
     still shows phases through M12. That means the calculator isn’t actually
     using the workstream duration when creating phases. Have Replit:
      - Log the computed totalMonths during timeline calculation for this run.
      - Confirm whether the program’s phases field in the DB was updated with
        the new logic or still hard-coded.

        The main problems are:                                                        
                                                                                
  1. EPM Title Bug: The program title is AI-generated and doesn't use the       
  journey/strategy name. Need to find where the title is generated and use the  
  actual business name.                                                         
  2. WBS Builder Not Using Business Context: The workstreams describe food      
  service, not a sneaker store. The WBS Builder isn't receiving or using the    
  actual business context.                                                      
  3. Timeline fix didn't work: Phases still show 0-12 when workstreams only go  
  to Month 3.                                                                   
                                                                                
  Tell Replit to investigate:                                                   
  - Where does the EPM program title come from? (Should use journey name, not AI
   generation)                                                                  
  - Why is WBS Builder generating food service workstreams for a sneaker store? 
  - Why is the timeline still showing 12 months when the fix was applied?
