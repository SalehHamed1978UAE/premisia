 ### Restore the button and label

  - On the Strategy detail page, the button next to the title must be “Start New
    Journey” (not “New Strategy” or anything else).
  - Clicking it should not navigate away immediately.

  ### Launch the Journey modal instead of redirecting

  - Keep the existing “Start New Journey” button wired to the Journey Launcher
    modal (the one we planned in Phase 4).
  - Opening the modal should pull context from the current understandingId.
    Show what’s already available (entity count, reference count, previous
    frameworks, etc.).

  ### Journey options in the modal

  - Modal needs two paths (same interface we specced):
      1. Run a full journey – user chooses a journey type.
      2. Run a single framework – user picks one or more frameworks.
  - For each choice, call POST /api/journeys/check-readiness with the current
    understandingId and the selected journey/framework. Use the result to decide
    whether we can run immediately or need more info.

  ### If ready to run

  - When the readiness API returns ready, give the user the option to “Start in
    Background” (call the background execution API and close the modal).
  - In parallel, drop a toast like “Journey queued – you’ll get a notification
    when it’s done.”

  ### If more input is required

  - Show the missing items in the modal (e.g., “Need pricing clarification”)
    along with buttons/links to gather that input.
  - If running immediately is still useful (user is willing to supply info
    manually), the modal can offer a “Continue in Journey Builder” button.

  ### When we do need manual input

  - Navigating into the Strategic Consultant should happen only if the readiness
    check says We need more input.
  - The link should be to "/strategic-consultant/journey-selection/
    ${understandingId}" (or the full wizard route), not the raw input page.
  - In that flow, preload the stored strategic input and clarifications so the
    user doesn’t have to re-type anything.

  ### Ensure context reuse

  - Any time /strategic-consultant/... is opened with an understandingId,
    automatically load the existing understanding (title, text, clarifications,
    document extracts).
  - Hide or disable the raw text area when context is already present; show “You
    are continuing the strategy: <title>”.

  ### Summary of acceptance criteria

  - Button label back to “Start New Journey”.
  - Modal opens with current strategy context.
  - Readiness check runs for both journeys and single frameworks.
  - If ready, allow background start (no redirection).
  - If not ready, list what’s missing and link to the right part of the wizard.
  - If we redirect into the Strategic Consultant flow, it must land on journey
    selection with all prior inputs loaded.

  Once this is implemented, users can truly kick off new journeys or single
  frameworks using existing context without being dumped into the blank input
  form.


› i made a mistake. it chenged th eburtton from "start new journey" to "add
  journey version" which is still dont like. i think it should be something
  like "reanalyze your hourney" or "continue your journey" or something. think
  about it and provide a better name for the button and then reprovide me the
  whole direction you just sentto correct replit and fix the mistakes its
  missing.


• Let’s get the button and flow aligned with the architecture we designed:

  ———

  ### 1. Button label & behavior

  - Change the button label on the Strategy detail header to “Run Additional
    Analysis”.
  - Clicking it should open the Journey Launcher modal (do not navigate away
    immediately).

  ### 2. Journey Launcher modal

  When the modal opens:

  - Pull the current strategy context using the understandingId.
  - Display summary chips (e.g., “47 knowledge entities”, “23 references”,
    completed frameworks).
  - Provide two tabs/options inside the modal:
      1. Full Journey – user selects a journey type (Business Model Innovation,
         Competitive Strategy, etc.).
      2. Single Framework – user selects one or more frameworks (Porter’s,
         PESTLE, SWOT, etc.).

  ### 3. Readiness evaluation

  - When the user selects a journey or framework, call the readiness API (POST /
    api/journeys/check-readiness) with the understandingId and the requested
    journey/framework.
  - If the response returns ready: true, enable “Run Now” and “Run in
    Background”.
  - If ready: false, show the missing requirements with actionable items (e.g.,
    “Add pricing reference”, “Clarify buyer profile”) in the modal.

  ### 4. Background execution

  - If the user chooses “Run in Background,” enqueue the job using the
    background execution endpoints we planned and close the modal. Drop a toast
    like “Analysis queued—you’ll be notified when it’s complete.”
  - Notification system should already surface status updates via
    useJobNotifications.

  ### 5. Handling missing inputs

  - If the readiness check says we still need user input, provide a button
    labeled “Continue in Journey Builder” (or similar) inside the modal.
  - That link should route to the Strategic Consultant’s journey selection path:
    "/strategic-consultant/journey-selection/${understandingId}".
  - When this route loads and there’s an understandingId, it must preload
    the existing strategic input, clarifications, and uploaded documents
    automatically. Hide the raw text box to make it clear the user is continuing
    an existing initiative.

  ### 6. No surprise redirects

  - The button should never drop users into the blank Strategic Consultant
    input screen unless the readiness evaluator explicitly says more input
    is required, and even then, send them directly to journey selection with
    context loaded.

  ### 7. Acceptance criteria

  - Button reads “Run Additional Analysis” and only opens the modal.
  - Modal shows strategy context and offers journey or single-framework options.
  - Readiness check runs for both paths and controls whether the job can start
    or you need more input.
  - Background queue available when ready; no navigation if the user chooses
    that path.
  - “Continue” routes to the journey selection wizard with existing context
    filled in.

  Once you make these changes, the user experience will be: see what you’ve
  already built, press “Run Additional Analysis,” decide whether to run a full
  journey or a single framework, and either fire it off in the background or
  supply the missing inputs—all without getting kicked back to a blank canvas.
