Here’s what we need you to do to bring the Strategy Hub back in line with the
  agreed design.

  ## Fix the “Run Additional Analysis” Flow

  1. Button label & action
      - Change the primary action button on the Strategy detail page back to a
        journey-specific label: “Run Additional Analysis.”
      - The button must open the Journey Launcher modal (no direct navigation).
  2. Journey Launcher modal
      - When the modal opens, load the current strategy’s context (entity count,
        reference count, completed frameworks).
      - Present two options/tabs:
          - Full Journey: user selects a journey type (e.g., Business Model
            Innovation, Competitive Strategy).
          - Single Framework: user selects one/more frameworks (Porter’s,
            PESTLE, etc.).
      - After a selection, call POST /api/journeys/check-readiness with the
        understandingId and the selected journey/framework.
  3. Readiness handling
      - If the API returns ready: true, show “Run Now” and “Start in Background”
        buttons.
          - “Run Now” should later start the synchronous path (once
            implemented).
          - “Start in Background” must enqueue the journey/framework via the
            background execution endpoint, close the modal, and show a toast
            (“Analysis queued—you’ll be notified when it’s complete.”).
      - If ready: false, display the missing requirements (e.g., “Need pricing
        reference”) inside the modal. Include buttons/links to collect those
        inputs.
  4. Routing when input is needed
      - Only when the readiness API says more input is required should we
        navigate the user to the Strategic Consultant flow.
      - That navigation must go to "/strategic-consultant/journey-selection/
        ${understandingId}" (the journey wizard), not the raw input page.
      - When that route loads with an understandingId, automatically preload the
        stored strategic input, clarifications, and uploaded documents. Hide the
        raw text area so it’s clear the user is continuing an existing strategy.
  5. Avoid direct redirects
      - Remove any code that currently takes the user straight to the blank
        Strategic Consultant page when the button is clicked.
      - The only time we should land in the journey wizard is after the
        readiness check indicates additional info is needed.

  ## Keep Following the Overall Roadmap

  Once the modal flow is fixed, continue with the remaining phases in the
  original plan:

  - Phase 3: Research Library enhancements (inline citations, Research
    Foundation tab, export updates).
  - Phase 4: Implement readiness evaluator/config and context inheritance
    service (you’ll already have part of this from the work above).
  - Phase 5: Background execution + notification wiring for journeys and single-
    framework runs.
  - Phase 6: Knowledge graph panel & entity usage navigation.
  - Phase 7: QA, regression tests, documentation.

  ## Reminders

  - Stick to the naming we’ve been using: “Strategy” = the umbrella initiative,
    “Journey” = multi-framework run, “Framework” = individual analysis.
  - Continue following the design guidelines in design_guidelines.md (spacing,
    typography, cards, dark-mode compatibility).
  - Do not reintroduce navigation changes that break the reuse flow (no blank
    inputs).

  Once these adjustments are in place, we’ll retest the Strategy Hub and move
  on.
