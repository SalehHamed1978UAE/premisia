Good fixes. Now run a fresh journey to verify all three work together.

  Issue: EPM Title

  Issue: Timeline 12mo fallback                                                 
  Fix: assignDefaultTimings() creates compact staggered timeline (4-5 months for
                                                                                
    8 workstreams) when intelligent planning fails                              
  Important Note from Replit                                                    
                                                                                
  The "food service" workstreams appearing for a sneaker store is a separate    
  issue - the SWOT analysis itself may have been run with wrong business context
   from a previous session. The EPM generator can only work with what the SWOT  
  analysis provides.                                                            
                                                                                
  Test Steps                                                                    
                                                                                
  1. Start a brand new custom journey for "Premium Sneaker Store Abu Dhabi"     
  2. Complete SWOT analysis                                                     
  3. Complete Strategic Decisions                                               
  4. Generate EPM                                                               
  5. Verify:                                                                    
    - EPM title matches your journey name (not AI-generated)                    
    - Workstreams relate to sneaker retail (not food service)                   
    - Timeline phases match actual workstream durations (not hardcoded 12       
  months)                                                                       
    - Export ZIP name matches UI card name                                      
                                                                                
  If workstreams are still wrong in the new journey, that points to the         
  SWOT/framework executor not receiving correct business context - a different  
  bug upstream from EPM generation.
