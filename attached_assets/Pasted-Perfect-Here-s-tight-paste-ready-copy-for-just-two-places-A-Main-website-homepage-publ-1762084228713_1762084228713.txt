Perfect. Here’s **tight, paste-ready copy** for just two places:

* **A. Main website homepage (public)**
* **B. In-app onboarding (first login)**

Use exactly as written or mix the interchangeable variants I’ve included.

# A) Main Website Homepage

## Hero

**Subhead:** Premisia structures complex choices so leaders can align, commit, and move—fast.
**Primary CTA:** Run a Strategy Sprint →
**Secondary CTA:** See a 5-minute demo →

## Proof strip (optional, one line)

Clear thinking for high-stakes decisions—used by strategy, finance, and delivery teams.

## Value pillars (4 x short)

* **Structured thinking** – Explore options, trade-offs, and constraints with guided prompts.
* **Alignment that sticks** – Capture assumptions and risks in one place; reach a shared “yes.”
* **Execution-ready** – Generate charters, budgets, KPIs, RAID/RACI, owners, and dates.
* **Learns as you go** – Plans refine as outcomes land; your strategy stays live.

## How it works (3 steps)

1. **Ingest & orient** – Goals, policies, numbers, prior plans.
2. **Think it through** – Scenarios, trade-offs, and stakeholder alignment.
3. **Commit & ship** – Export an execution-ready program to your tools.

## What you get

* Program **charter** • **Costs & benefits** view • **OKRs/KPIs**
* **RAID** log & **RACI** • **Timeline & milestones** • **Decision log** with assumptions

## Integrations (short)

Export: **Jira / Azure DevOps / Asana / Monday**
Connect: **SharePoint / Google Drive / Confluence / Notion**
Access: **SSO (Microsoft / Google)**

## Trust (mini)

Encryption at rest & in transit • RBAC & SSO/SAML • Configurable retention • Optional customer-managed keys • Decision logs & audit trails.

# B) In-App Onboarding (First Login)

## Welcome panel

**Welcome to Premisia**
**Tagline:** Think it through.

**What we’ll do in ~10 minutes**

1. Set your **goal & constraints**
2. Add **context** (docs, numbers, prior plans)
3. Explore **options & trade-offs**
4. Generate an **execution-ready program**

**Primary button:** Start a Strategy Sprint →
**Secondary:** Explore a sample decision →

---

## Step 1: Goal & scope (card copy)

* **Goal (required):** What outcome are we aiming for?
* **Constraints (optional):** Budget, dates, compliance, capacity.
* **Stakeholders (optional):** Who must agree?

*Tip:* Be specific—Premisia will suggest scenarios based on this.

**Button:** Continue →

---

## Step 2: Context (upload/connect)

**Add context** (choose any):

* Upload slides, briefs, or budgets
* Link policies or prior programs
* Connect SharePoint / Google Drive

*Note:* You can start with zero files—attach more later.

**Button:** Continue →

---

## Step 3: Scenarios & trade-offs

**Proposed scenarios** (editable):

* **Option A:** [Short label] – strengths, risks, dependencies
* **Option B:** [Short label] – strengths, risks, dependencies
* **Option C:** [Short label] – strengths, risks, dependencies

**Compare:** impact • cost • time • risk • confidence
**Capture:** assumptions you accept or reject.

**Buttons:** Save comparison • Continue →

---

## Step 4: Alignment & decision

**Alignment check**

* Unresolved risks → suggestions
* Stakeholder concerns → notes
* Decision log → “why we chose X”

**Decision:** Choose a path → (A / B / C)
**Button:** Generate program →

---

## Output screen (Program generated)

**Your program is ready**
Included: Charter • Costs & benefits • OKRs/KPIs • RAID • RACI • Timeline & milestones • Decision log

**Export to:** Jira / ADO / Asana / PDF • **Share** for review

**Buttons:** Export to Jira • Share for approval • Edit components

---

## Ongoing loop (after export)

**Live refinement**
Premisia watches outcomes and changes in context, then proposes updates.
**Buttons:** Review updates • Snooze • Adjust thresholds

---

## Onboarding side-tips (right rail / tooltips)

* **Assumptions** – “The reasoning behind a recommendation. Change an assumption and Premisia re-evaluates.”
* **Decision log** – “What changed minds—and why. Great for boards and audits.”
* **RAID** – “Risks, Assumptions, Issues, Dependencies captured in one place.”
* **Owners & dates** – “Assign real accountability before export.”

---

## Empty states (friendly, concise)

* **No scenarios yet** – “Add an option or attach context to get suggestions.”
* **No risks logged** – “Add your first risk. Premisia will suggest mitigations.”
* **No stakeholders set** – “Add the people who must agree. We’ll track alignment.”

---

## Microcopy (buttons & modals)

* **Buttons:** Start now • Continue • Save comparison • Generate program • Export • Share
* **Success:** “Saved.” • “Program generated.” • “Export queued.”
* **Warnings:** “One assumption is missing. Add or mark N/A to continue.”
* **Errors:** “We couldn’t save this yet. Try again or export locally.”

---

## Security notice (inline)

“Your data is encrypted at rest and in transit. Admins can set retention and residency preferences.”

---

## Quick presets (optional templates shown on first login)

* **Cost takeout (30–90 days)** – trade-offs across scope, speed, impact
* **AI adoption sprint (pilot → scale)** – value, risk, governance
* **Portfolio reprioritization** – impact vs. capacity vs. risk
* **Platform build (data/AI/ERP)** – time, budget, critical path, dependencies

**Button (per card):** Use this template →

---

## Final nudge (if user pauses)

**Still thinking?**
Start with one option. You can add context and refine later.
**Button:** Start a blank Sprint →

---

If you want, I can also turn these into **Tailwind components** (hero section + onboarding flow panels) or a **Gamma 4-slide script** for sales/demo—same copy, ready to paste.
