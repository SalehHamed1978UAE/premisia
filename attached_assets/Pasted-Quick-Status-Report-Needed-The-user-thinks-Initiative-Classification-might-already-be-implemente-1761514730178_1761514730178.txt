Quick Status Report Needed:

  The user thinks Initiative Classification might already be implemented 
  because they see a business type confirmation step.

  Please clarify what's actually in the codebase:

  1. Database Schema

  # Check if initiative_type exists
  psql $DATABASE_URL -c "\d strategic_understanding" | grep initiative

  Does strategic_understanding table have:
  - initiative_type column?
  - initiative_description column?
  - user_confirmed column?
  - classification_confidence column?

  2. Backend Services

  Do these files exist?
  - server/strategic-consultant/initiative-classifier.ts
  - server/strategic-consultant/quality-validator.ts

  3. Frontend Confirmation

  Is there a page/component where users confirm their initiative type?
  - client/src/pages/strategic-consultant/ClassificationPage.tsx

  4. Context Propagation

  When EPM generates resources, does it:
  - Read initiative_type from the database?
  - Pass it to task extraction?
  - Pass it to resource generation?
  - Generate different resources based on type (Baristas for coffee shops vs 
  Developers for software)?

  5. Test Question

  If you run this query, what does it return?
  SELECT initiative_type, initiative_description, user_confirmed
  FROM strategic_understanding
  ORDER BY created_at DESC
  LIMIT 3;

  Are the fields populated? Or NULL?

  What We Need to Know:

  A) Initiative Classification is fully implemented → Resources are 
  context-aware

  B) Partially implemented → Database exists but not used in EPM generation

  C) Not implemented → User is seeing ambiguity detection, not classification

  D) Something else → Explain what's there

  Please report back with findings! 🔍

  🤔 My Hypothesis:

  I think what happened is:

  Ambiguity Detection (which we know is done) might be asking:
  - "Is this B2B or B2C?"
  - "Physical or digital?"
  - "What industry?"

  And the user is seeing these questions and thinking "This is business type
  classification!"

  But Initiative Classification is different - it's:
  1. AI automatically detects type ("physical_business_launch")
  2. Shows confidence score
  3. Stores in database
  4. Uses that type throughout EPM generation

  The key difference is step 4 - does EPM actually use the business type to
  generate different resources?
