The code might be correct, but the flow is still broken.                      
                                                                                
  Replit improved the decision generation logic, but the user's screenshot shows
   the journey ends at /strategies/:id after SWOT instead of continuing to      
  Strategic Decisions.                                                          
                                                                                
  Ask Replit to verify:                                                         
                                                                                
  1. After SWOT completes in a custom journey, does the executor actually hit   
  the user-input detection code?                                                
  2. Is user_input_required SSE event being emitted?                            
  3. Is the frontend receiving that event and redirecting to DecisionPage?      
                                                                                
  The test should show:                                                         
  [CustomJourneyExecutor] SWOT complete                                         
  [CustomJourneyExecutor] Next step: strategic-decisions (user-input type)      
  [CustomJourneyExecutor] Emitting user_input_required event                    
  [CustomJourneyExecutor] Redirect URL: /strategy-workspace/decisions/xxx/1     
                                                                                
  If those logs don't appear, the journey is ending before it reaches Strategic 
  Decisions. The decision generation code never runs if the flow doesn't get    
  there.                                                                        
                                                                                
  Tell Replit: "Test the actual journey flow, not just the decision generation  
  code. Start a custom journey with SWOT → Strategic Decisions, complete SWOT,  
  and verify the SSE event fires and redirects to DecisionPage. The user is     
  still landing on /strategies/:id instead of the decision page."
