Yep—Replit’s diagnosis is right: we have two different “session” IDs and we’re
  mixing them up.

  - sessionId (format session-…) comes from the strategic‑understanding flow and
    is what the analysis, versions, and research endpoints use.
  - journeySessionId is the UUID returned by /api/strategic-consultant/journeys/
    execute; this is the primary key in the journey_sessions table.

  Any route that hits getJourneySession (e.g. /api/strategic-consultant/
  journeys/:id/results) expects that UUID. Because the frontend never stores or
  forwards journeySessionId, it ends up calling those routes with the session-…
  string, and the lookup fails.

  Fix for Replit

  1. Store the journey session ID when the journey starts.
     In client/src/pages/strategic-consultant/JourneySelectionPage.tsx, after
     parsing the execute response, capture the journeySessionId and append it to
     the navigation URL:

     const result = await response.json();

     localStorage.setItem(
       `journey-session-${result.sessionId}`,
       result.journeySessionId
     );

     const destination = new URL(result.navigationUrl, window.location.origin);
     destination.searchParams.set("journeySession", result.journeySessionId);
     setLocation(destination.pathname + destination.search);
     (Keep the existing journey-type-${result.sessionId} entry too.)
     (Keep the existing journey-type-${result.sessionId} entry too.)
  2. Read the stored value wherever we need it.
     In pages that expect a journeySession query parameter (e.g. InputPage.tsx)
     add a fallback to the stored mapping:

     const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
     const journeySessionId =
       urlParams.get("journeySession") ??
       (sessionId ? localStorage.getItem(`journey-session-${sessionId}`) :
  null);

     Use that journeySessionId for any API calls that hit journeySessions.
  3. When fetching journey results or progress, make sure we send the UUID:

     const journeySessionId =
       params?.sessionId ??
       localStorage.getItem(`journey-session-${params?.sessionId}`);
     const res = await fetch(
       `/api/strategic-consultant/journeys/${journeySessionId}/results`
     );

  After doing that, the backend will receive the UUID it expects, so /api/
  strategic-consultant/journeys/:id/results, progress polling, and similar calls
  will stop failing. If you want to keep existing URLs clean, keep the query
  parameter and the localStorage mapping in sync so every page can recover the
  UUID even on reload.
