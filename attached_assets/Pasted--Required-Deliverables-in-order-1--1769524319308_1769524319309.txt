  Only after we see #5 do we discuss code changes.                              
                                                                                
  The baseline test run is critical - it tells us:                              
  - What currently works (must not break)                                       
  - What currently fails (what we're fixing)                                    
  - The exact scope of the problem                                              
                                                                                
  If Replit skips any of these steps, we'll end up firefighting again. Hold them
   to completing all 5 before any orchestrator changes.
