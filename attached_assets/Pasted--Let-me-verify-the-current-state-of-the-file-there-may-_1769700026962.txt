  The registry is correct. Replit is looking at the wrong line - line 64 is     
  actually a comment for Competitive Strategy, not Market Entry.                
                                                                                
  Tell Replit:                                                                  
                                                                                
  ---                                                                           
  The registry is already correct - I just verified:                            
  - market_entry at line 53 has available: false                                
  - Only business_model_innovation has available: true                          
                                                                                
  The problem is enforcement, not the registry values. Replit's task list is    
  still valid:                                                                  
                                                                                
  1. ✅ Registry is already correct - no change needed                          
  2. Add startup validation - verify executors exist for available: true        
  journeys                                                                      
  3. Fix frontend filtering - use getAvailableJourneys() not getAllJourneys()   
  4. Fix ResearchPage - check isJourneyAvailable() before proceeding            
                                                                                
  The user is somehow getting to Market Entry despite available: false. Find    
  where the frontend lets users select unavailable journeys and fix that guard.
