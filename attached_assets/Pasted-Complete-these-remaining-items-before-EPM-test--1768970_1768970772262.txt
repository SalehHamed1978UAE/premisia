Complete these remaining items before EPM test:                               
                                                                                
  1. Expand /docs/JOURNEY_ARCHITECTURE.md                                       
                                                                                
  Add these missing sections:                                                   
  - Overview section (the architecture diagram showing Journey = [Module1] →    
  [Module2] → ... → [EPM Output])                                               
  - Additional framework rows: PESTLE (6 factors), Five Whys (root cause        
  analysis)                                                                     
  - Rule #4: Use Context Accumulator for Data Flow                              
  // ❌ WRONG - Passing data directly between components                        
  const bmcInput = fiveWhysOutput.rootCauses;                                   
                                                                                
  // ✅ CORRECT - Use the accumulator                                           
  import { addFrameworkResult } from '../journey/strategic-context-accumulator';
  context = addFrameworkResult(context, fiveWhysResult);                        
                                                                                
  2. Add test to tests/journeys/journey-architecture.spec.js                    
                                                                                
  Add test for "no hardcoded BMC blocks in shared components":                  
  it('should not contain hardcoded BMC blocks in shared components', () => {    
    const bmcBlocks = [                                                         
      'customer_segments',                                                      
      'value_propositions',                                                     
      'revenue_streams',                                                        
      'key_resources',                                                          
      'key_activities',                                                         
      'key_partnerships',                                                       
      'cost_structure'                                                          
    ];                                                                          
    // Check PortersResearchExperience.tsx doesn't have these                   
  });                                                                           
                                                                                
  3. Add note about test command                                                
                                                                                
  Since package.json can't be edited, add to the warning block in REPLIT.md:    
  ### Run Journey Tests                                                         
  npx jest tests/journeys/ --passWithNoTests                                    
                                                                                
  ---                                                                           
  Once these are done, we have full guardrail coverage and can run the          
  multi-agent EPM test.
