Replit Integration Task - EPM Display Fix
Context: EPM programs currently show raw JSON. We have complete formatter components ready to replace JSON with beautiful, user-friendly displays.
Files to integrate:

EPMFormatters.tsx (1,200 lines - 14 formatter components)
EPMProgramView.tsx (modified - uses formatters instead of JSON)


Task 1: Create EPM Components Directory
bashmkdir -p client/src/components/epm
Verification: Directory client/src/components/epm exists

Task 2: Add EPMFormatters.tsx
Source: User will provide EPMFormatters.tsx file
Destination: client/src/components/epm/EPMFormatters.tsx
Action: Copy the complete file to this location
Verification: File exists and imports work (check for TypeScript errors)

Task 3: Verify Intelligence Types
Check: Does client/src/types/intelligence.ts exist?
If NO: The types might be in a different location. Search for:

ExecutiveSummary interface
Workstream interface
Timeline interface

If found elsewhere: Update the import in EPMFormatters.tsx line 27:
typescriptimport { ... } from "@/types/intelligence";
Change to the correct path.
If not found at all: We'll need to create the types file (unlikely - these should exist)
Verification: EPMFormatters.tsx imports resolve without errors

Task 4: Update EPMProgramView.tsx
Source: User will provide modified EPMProgramView.tsx
Destination: client/src/pages/strategy-workspace/EPMProgramView.tsx
Action: REPLACE the existing file
Key changes in new file:

Lines 1-28: Added imports for all 14 formatters
Lines 180-195: New renderComponent() function maps component names to formatters
Line 216: Uses renderComponent() instead of JSON.stringify()

Verification: File compiles without TypeScript errors

Task 5: Test EPM Display
Steps:

Start the app
Navigate to an existing EPM program (or generate a new one)
Check all 7 tabs:

Summary → Should show formatted Executive Summary (NOT JSON)
Planning → Should show formatted Workstreams, Timeline, Stage Gates
Resources → Should show formatted Resource Plan, Financial Plan
Benefits → Should show formatted Benefits Realization, KPIs
Risks → Should show formatted Risk Register
Governance → Should show formatted Stakeholder Map, Governance
Other → Should show formatted QA Plan, Procurement, Exit Strategy



Expected result: All components display with:

✅ Cards with proper styling
✅ Badges for confidence scores (green/yellow/red)
✅ Icons (Users, Calendar, DollarSign, etc.)
✅ Tables for financial data
✅ Bullet lists for strategic items
✅ Color-coded risk levels
✅ NO raw JSON visible anywhere

Edit functionality test:

Click "Edit" button on any component
Should show JSON textarea (this is correct for editing)
Make a change and click "Save"
Should return to formatted display

Verification: All tabs display formatted, edit works, no console errors

Rollback Plan (If Issues)
If integration fails:

Keep new EPMFormatters.tsx (it's isolated, won't break anything)
Restore old EPMProgramView.tsx from git history
Report which specific error occurred


Common Issues & Solutions
Issue: Import errors for @/types/intelligence
Fix: Find where intelligence types actually live and update import path
Issue: lucide-react icons not found
Fix: Run npm install lucide-react
Issue: shadcn/ui components not found
Fix: Verify @/components/ui/badge, @/components/ui/card etc. all exist

Summary for Replit
Replace raw JSON displays with professional formatters:

Create folder: client/src/components/epm
Add EPMFormatters.tsx to that folder
Replace client/src/pages/strategy-workspace/EPMProgramView.tsx
Verify types import correctly
Test all 7 EPM tabs show formatted output

Files provided by user - copy exactly as-is.
