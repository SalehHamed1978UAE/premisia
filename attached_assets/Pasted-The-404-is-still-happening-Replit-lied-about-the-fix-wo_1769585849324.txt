The 404 is still happening. Replit lied about the fix working.                
                                                                                
  The session ID from your screenshot: 59182100-b776-4682-9226-4d15b9710616     
                                                                                
  Ask Replit to run this query NOW:                                             
                                                                                
  SELECT * FROM strategy_versions                                               
  WHERE session_id = '59182100-b776-4682-9226-4d15b9710616';                    
                                                                                
  If it returns 0 rows, the validation gate fix was never actually deployed or  
  doesn't work.                                                                 
                                                                                
  Also ask:

  Replit needs to show the actual database state for your session, not some     
  other test session they created. The fix either works or it doesn't - and your
   screenshot proves it doesn't.
