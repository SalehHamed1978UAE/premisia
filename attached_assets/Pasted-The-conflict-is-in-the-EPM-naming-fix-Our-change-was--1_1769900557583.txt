The conflict is in the EPM naming fix. Our change was:                        
                                                                                
  Before (my change):                                                           
  .where(eq(strategicUnderstanding.id, version.sessionId))                      
                                                                                
  After (my change):                                                            
  .where(eq(strategicUnderstanding.sessionId, version.sessionId))               
                                                                                
  But based on your earlier investigation, the issue is that version.sessionId  
  is a session string like session-1769898649296-uocxqo which doesn't match     
  either format.                                                                
                                                                                
  To resolve the conflict on Replit:                                            
                                                                                
  1. Click on strategy-workspace.ts to see the conflict markers                 
  2. If Replit has a better fix for the sessionId lookup (based on the session  
  string format), accept their version                                          
  3. If they want to use our approach, accept incoming changes                  
                                                                                
  The key question is: what does strategicUnderstanding.sessionId actually      
  contain? If it stores session strings like session-xxx, then my fix should    
  work. If it stores UUIDs, then a different approach is needed.                
                                                                                
  Can you share what fix Replit proposed for the sessionId mismatch?
