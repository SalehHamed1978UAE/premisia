  BUG: legacy-generator.ts line 64 creates new EPMSynthesizer() without an LLM  
  provider, causing WBS Builder to crash and fall back to garbage templates.    
  FIX: Pass an LLM provider to the constructor.                                 
                                                                                
  What Should Happen After the Fix

  Deliverables: "Initiative Charter", "Implementation Plan", "Progress Report

  After (fixed):                                                                
  Workstream: "Location Scouting & Lease Negotiation"                           
  Deliverables: "Signed commercial lease agreement", "Site assessment report",  
  "Lease terms finalized"                                                       
                                                                                
  The fix is 25 lines of code. Should be a 5-minute change for Replit.
