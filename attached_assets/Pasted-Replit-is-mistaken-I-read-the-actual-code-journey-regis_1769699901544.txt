Replit is mistaken. I read the actual code - journey-registry.ts:53 shows:    
                                                                                
  market_entry: {                                                               
    available: false, // Placeholder - not implemented                          
                                                                                
  Market Entry is already marked unavailable. The problem is the system isn't   
  enforcing this.

  Correction: Market Entry is already available: false in                       
  server/journey/journey-registry.ts:53. The registry is correct - the          
  enforcement is broken.                                                        
                                                                                
  Priority order:                                                               
                                                                                
  1. Fix the orchestrator to validate at startup (Option 3)                     
    - On server start, loop through all journeys where available: true          
    - Verify every framework in journey.frameworks is registered in             
  frameworkRegistry                                                             
    - Throw error and halt startup if mismatch found                            
    - This prevents shipping broken journeys ever again                         
  2. Fix the frontend to respect available flag                                 
    - Journey selection UI should filter getAvailableJourneys() not             
  getAllJourneys()                                                              
    - ResearchPage should check journey availability before proceeding          
  3. Don't build new executors yet                                              
    - First we need module specs, input/output contracts, and tests for existing
   modules (FiveWhys, BMC)                                                      
    - Building PESTLE/Porters/SWOT without contracts will create more technical 
  debt                                                                          
                                                                                
  The startup validation should look like:                                      
                                                                                
  // In server startup (e.g., index.ts or register-frameworks.ts)               
  export function validateJourneyIntegrity(): void {                            
    const availableJourneys = getAvailableJourneys();                           
                                                                                
    for (const journey of availableJourneys) {                                  
      for (const framework of journey.frameworks) {                             
        if (!frameworkRegistry.has(framework)) {                                
          throw new Error(                                                      
            `STARTUP ERROR: Journey "${journey.name}" requires framework        
  "${framework}" but no executor is registered. ` +                             
            `Either register the executor or set available: false in            
  journey-registry.ts`                                                          
          );                                                                    
        }                                                                       
      }                                                                         
    }                                                                           
                                                                                
    console.log(`[Journey Validation] ✓ All ${availableJourneys.length}         
  available journeys have registered executors`);                               
  }                                                                             
                                                                                
  Call this after registerFrameworkExecutors() in server startup.
