The test script looks good structurally. However, I notice that T002 doesn't  
  actually test the race condition - it creates data synchronously in setup(),  
  which will always pass.                                                       
                                                                                
  The real test for T002 should be:                                             
  1. Trigger the actual journey transition (call the journey executor)          
  2. Wait for the redirect URL to be returned                                   
  3. Check if strategy_versions exists at that moment                           
                                                                                
  But this is a good starting baseline for schema validation. Let's proceed:    
                                                                                
  Ask Replit to:                                                                
                                                                                
  1. Write the file to disk - Create scripts/regression-test.ts                 
  2. Run it - npx tsx scripts/regression-test.ts                                
  3. Show the output - Screenshot or paste the terminal output                  
                                                                                
  We should see all 3 tests pass (since we're testing setup, not the actual     
  async flow). This confirms:                                                   
  - Database schema is correct                                                  
  - Relationships work                                                          
  - We have a working test infrastructure                                       
                                                                                
  Then we can add a T002-async test that actually triggers the journey flow and 
  exposes the race condition. That test should FAIL, proving the bug exists     
  before we fix it.
