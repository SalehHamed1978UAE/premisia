The last run did write out a golden record (scripts/output/golden-records/
  business_model_innovation/v5_…json), but it’s basically empty—steps and
  metadata.frameworks are []. That means the capture code isn’t seeing any of
  the journey steps, so the record is useless even though the file exists.

  ### Why it happened

  fetchJourneySessionData() (in server/utils/golden-records-service.ts) still
  looks for session.completedFrameworks and similar legacy signals. In the
  current BMI pipeline those fields are empty, so the function never adds any
  steps. Hence the golden record JSON ends up like:

  {
    "journeyType": "business_model_innovation",
    "versionNumber": 5,
    "steps": [],            ← no Five Whys / BMC / Decisions / Prioritization /
  EPM
    "metadata": { "frameworks": [] }
  }

  ### What needs to change

  Update fetchJourneySessionData() so it builds the step sequence from the
  actual artifacts we store now:

  1. Five Whys – detect via session.accumulatedContext.insights.fiveWhys or
     versions[*].analysisData.five_whys.
  2. BMC Research – check latestVersion.analysisData.bmc_research.
  3. Strategic Decisions – check latestVersion.decisionsData.
  4. Prioritization – check latestVersion.selectedDecisions.
  5. EPM Generation – check epmPrograms for this strategy version.

  Tie this to the canonical step IDs (JourneyStepId.BMI_FIVE_WHYS, etc.)
  so we know exactly what was executed. This is also a good place to log
  completedStepIds on the session so capture isn’t guessing.

  ### What to ask Replit to do

  1. Patch server/utils/golden-records-service.ts to populate steps using the
     concrete data above (and fill metadata.frameworks properly).
  2. Re-run the capture for the latest BMI session:

     npx tsx scripts/golden-record-capture.ts --sessionId=<sessionId> --promote
     or toggle the auto-capture flag and re-run the journey.
  3. Optionally delete the empty golden records (v3–v5) or mark them deprecated.

  Once that’s done, your next capture will include the full journey (Five Whys →
  BMC → Decisions → Prioritization → EPM) and screenshots, and the golden record
  system will be meaningful again.
