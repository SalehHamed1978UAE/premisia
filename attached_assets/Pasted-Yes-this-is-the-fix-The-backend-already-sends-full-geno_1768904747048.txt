Yes - this is the fix. The backend already sends full genome data at ~174s,   
  but the frontend throws it away.                                              
                                                                                
  Simple frontend fix needed:                                                   
                                                                                
  // Current (broken) - line 259-262                                            
  setStreamingState(prev => ({                                                  
    ...prev,                                                                    
    scoredCount: data.scoredCount || 0,  // ← Wrong field name, ignores actual  
  data                                                                          
  }));                                                                          
                                                                                
  // Fixed - use the actual genome data                                         
  setStreamingState(prev => ({                                                  
    ...prev,                                                                    
    scoredCount: data.scored?.length || prev.scoredCount,                       
    topGenomes: data.scored || prev.topGenomes,  // ← Render these as preview!  
    progress: data.progress || prev.progress,                                   
  }));                                                                          
                                                                                
  Then update the UI to show streamingState.topGenomes as early preview cards.  
                                                                                
  Expected result:                                                              
  - TTFUR drops from ~193s to ~174s (19 second improvement)                     
  - No change to total time (still ~227s)                                       
  - No added complexity - just using data that's already being sent             
                                                                                
  This is the quick win. Have Replit implement this fix and re-run the test.
