This is the right direction. But one critical question remains unanswered:    
                                                                                
  What Actually Broke?                                                          
                                                                                
  Replit said the SSE progress events showed real workstream names like "Office 
  Site Selection..." - this means the WBS Builder was producing good output     
  during execution. Then something happened between progress events and the     
  final save.                                                                   
                                                                                
  The task list shows "Fix builder failing during processing" but that's still  
  vague. Before they start coding, they need to identify:                       
  Question: What exception was thrown at line 134?                              
  Why It Matters: This tells us what actually failed

  Question: At what point in the pipeline did it fail?                          
  Why It Matters: Validation? Serialization? Database insert?

  Question: Why did progress events get good data but final output didn't?      
  Why It Matters: Are these separate code paths? Race condition?                
  Ask Replit to run a debug session with the Gaming Cafe session data (session  
  ID: ab28cdd6-df7b-4e26-a590-f10db973d54f) and actually capture:               
                                                                                
  1. The full stack trace when WBS Builder fails                                
  2. What data wbsBuilder.generate() returns vs what gets saved                 
  3. Where the divergence between SSE data and saved data occurs                
                                                                                
  Without knowing the actual failure, they're just adding logging and removing  
  fallbacks - which is good hygiene but doesn't fix the underlying bug. The WBS 
  Builder will still fail, it'll just fail loudly instead of silently.          
                                                                                
  The systematic approach is:                                                   
  1. Diagnose (find the actual exception/failure point)                         
  2. Fix (address root cause)                                                   
  3. Harden (remove fallbacks, add validation)                                  
  4. Verify (automated E2E test)                                                
                                                                                
  Right now they're jumping to step 3 without completing steps 1-2.
