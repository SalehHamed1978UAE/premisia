I already pushed that fix. The expanded role templates are in the latest      
  commit.                                                                       
                                                                                
  Pull the latest code:                                                         
  git pull origin main                                                          
                                                                                
  The cafe_coffee_shop template now has:                                        
  cafe_coffee_shop: [                                                           
    // Core Operations                                                          
    { role: 'Cafe Operations Manager', ... },                                   
    { role: 'Head Barista', ... },                                              
    // Launch/Project Functional Roles                                          
    { role: 'Cafe Design & Construction Lead', ... },                           
    { role: 'Technology & Systems Specialist', ... },                           
    { role: 'HR & Training Coordinator', ... },                                 
    { role: 'Marketing & Community Manager', ... },                             
    { role: 'Compliance & Licensing Specialist', ... },                         
  ]                                                                             
                                                                                
  These role names contain keywords that match the workstream owner logic:      
  - "Construction" matches construction workstreams                             
  - "Technology" matches tech workstreams                                       
  - "HR & Training" matches talent/training workstreams                         
  - "Marketing" matches marketing workstreams                                   
  - "Compliance" matches compliance workstreams                                 
                                                                                
  Restaurant template also expanded similarly.                                  
                                                                                
  Just pull and restart - no additional changes needed.
