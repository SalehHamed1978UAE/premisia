Quick claim check (what stands + what to tune)

“AI delivers measurable ROI fast.”
✅ Supported. In EMEA, 66% of senior leaders already report significant productivity gains from AI; 92% expect measurable ROI from AI agents within two years.

 and

“Strategy → execution in minutes.”
⚠️ Directionally true as a differentiator (multi-agent workflows compress time), but avoid a universal time claim. Anchor it to speed vs. traditional consulting + field results on productivity/time-savings. See BCG’s controlled trials (material productivity uplift for knowledge workers) and Microsoft/UK government Copilot pilots (meaningful minutes saved per day → weeks per year).

“Market need is urgent and large.”
✅ Supported. GenAI’s economic upside is $2.6–$4.4T annually across use cases (McKinsey).

“Enterprise-grade + governance.”
✅ Directionally supported. Leaders prioritize openness, governance, and control; ethics & compliance readiness are decisive buying factors. (Use AES-256 as a clear, standard baseline; pair with governance and auditability.)

Note on the “94%” stat: your outline says “94% of leaders expect measurable returns from AI strategy tools (IBM data).” The IBM EMEA study reports 92% confidence in ROI from AI agents (not 94%). Recommend updating to 92% and citing IBM EMEA 2025.

Value pillars

Speed with substance
Compress weeks of slide-making and stakeholder wrangling into hours—with on-call agents for scenarios, risks, budgets, and benefits. Field studies show sizeable productivity lifts for knowledge work when AI assists complex tasks.

Evidence you can audit
Every recommendation carries sources, bias-checks, and assumptions so boards and auditors can trace decisions end-to-end.

Execution-ready, not just ideas
Output is EPM-structured (charter, milestones, costs, KPIs, RAID, RACI) and syncs with your delivery stack.

Enterprise-grade trust
AES-256 at rest & in transit, role-based controls, model routing, and policy-as-code to keep you compliant while moving fast. Leaders rank control, interoperability, and governance as top criteria for AI adoption. 

IBM EMEA Report - The Race for …

Continuous refinement
Strategies evolve as data changes—living programs that learn from outcomes.

Time back to think: Early enterprise Copilot users report daily minutes saved that add up to ~1–2 weeks/year; a UK government trial found ~26 minutes/day saved across 20k staff.

Macro tailwind: GenAI’s value pool is $2.6–$4.4T per year.

How it works (3 steps)

Ingest & map – Securely connect policies, financials, KPIs, and prior initiatives. QGentic builds a knowledge graph of your enterprise.

Strategize with agents – Advisory agents co-draft scenarios, trade-offs, and OKRs and run risk/compliance checks in-line.

Ship the program – Export to your PM suite with charter, plan, costs, KPIs, owners, and tracking—and keep iterating as conditions change.

1) Boardroom voice (credibility + outcomes)

Strategy shouldn’t take quarters. With QGentic, we’re compressing strategy-to-program from weeks to hours—with audit trails and budgets attached.
Across EMEA, 66% of leaders already see productivity gains from AI, and 92% expect measurable ROI from agents in two years. We’re here to make that tangible for boards and operators—not another chatbot, but multi-agent execution.

2) Operator voice (time-savings + proof)

Exec time is scarce. Early AI rollouts show real minutes back per day—adding up to weeks per year—for drafting, synthesis, and follow-ups. QGentic turns that reclaimed time into execution-ready programs with traceable evidence. Let’s use AI where the value is highest: strategy that ships.

3) Market voice (macro momentum)

GenAI’s upside is measured in trillions—but only if leaders can go from ideas to governed execution. QGentic uses multi-agent orchestration + knowledge graphs to generate programs you can fund, staff, and track. The result: speed with substance.

One-page “Why QGentic now” (sales enablement blurb)

The need: AI adoption is moving from pilots to platforms. Two-thirds of leaders already see productivity gains, and the majority expect agent-driven ROI on a near-term horizon—yet many still struggle to translate AI insights into fundable, governed programs.

The gap: Tools that summarize aren’t enough for boards and CFOs. They need assumptions, scenarios, budgets, KPIs, risk controls, and a way to learn.

The QGentic answer:

Multi-agent strategy engine that co-drafts programs (charter → plan → KPIs), backed by live citations & bias checks.

Enterprise guardrails (encryption, access controls, model governance) aligned to what buyers say they value most: control, interoperability, compliance.

Continuous refinement so your plan evolves with data and results.

Security & governance snippet (for site “Trust” page)

Security: AES-256 encryption in transit/at rest; SSO/SAML; granular RBAC; customer-managed keys (optional).

Privacy: Data isolation; redaction pipelines; configurable retention.

Governance: Model registry & routing; policy-as-code; bias/lineage reporting; full source traceability on recommendations.

Interoperability: Open connectors + export to your PM/BI stack—mirrors buyer priorities for openness and control.

What to say (and not say)

Say: “Cut weeks to hours with multi-agent strategy sprints,” “execution-ready outputs,” “governed, auditable decisions,” “continuous refinement.”

Avoid: Universal “10–30 minutes” claims. Use “hours, not weeks” unless you can reference your own measured benchmarks.
