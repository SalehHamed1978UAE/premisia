Root Cause Analysis - Resource Assignment Issue

  Problem: Resources are being created but NOT assigned to tasks in
  QgenticEPM3.

  Root Cause Found: Data structure mismatch between intelligent planning task
   format and assignment engine expectations.

  The Issue:

  Intelligent Planning generates tasks with:
  {
    name: "Design Database Schema",
    requirements: [
      { skill: "Database Design", quantity: 1, duration: 10 },
      { skill: "SQL", quantity: 1, duration: 10 }
    ]
  }

  Assignment Engine expects:
  {
    name: "Design Database Schema",
    skills: ["Database Design", "SQL"]  // Flat array
  }

  In /server/intelligence/epm-synthesizer.ts line 2083:
  requiredSkills: task.skills || []  // Always returns [] when task has 
  requirements instead!

  Result: Assignment matching fails because tasks have no requiredSkills, so:
  - Skill matching returns 0 points
  - Role matching might give +20 points
  - Very weak matches or NO matches
  - No assignments created!

  🔧 Fix Instructions for Replit

  File: /Users/salehyahyahamed/qgentic/QgenticEPM/QgenticEPM3/server/intellig
  ence/epm-synthesizer.ts

  Location: Lines 2075-2086 in the generateAssignments() method

  Change:
  // BEFORE (Line 2083):
  requiredSkills: task.skills || [],

  // AFTER:
  // Extract skills from requirements array (intelligent planning format)
  // or fall back to skills array (legacy format)
  requiredSkills: task.requirements
    ? task.requirements.map((req: any) => req.skill || req)
    : task.skills || [],

  This will:
  1. Check if task has requirements array (intelligent planning format)
  2. Extract the skill field from each requirement
  3. Fall back to task.skills for legacy format
  4. Enable proper skill matching in assignment engine

  Expected Result:
  - Tasks from intelligent planning will have proper requiredSkills populated
  - Assignment engine can match resources to tasks based on skills
  - Assignments will be created and saved to database
