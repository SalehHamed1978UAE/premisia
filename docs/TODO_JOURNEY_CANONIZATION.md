## Journey Canonization Follow-up (Deferred)

Status: deferred until BMI republish is stable.

Next major hardening track:
- Make one canonical execution authority for all journeys (YAML + canvas + wizard).
- Remove runtime route overrides and step-skipping band-aids.
- Enforce publish-time journey validation + golden-record replay gates.
- Require orchestrator state to drive navigation and step progression.
